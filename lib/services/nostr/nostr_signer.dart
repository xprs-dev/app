/*
 * NostrSigner — the seam between "this app can sign as you" and "this app holds
 * your secret key". Until now those were the same sentence.
 *
 * A user with a real NOSTR identity keeps it in Amber or a bunker precisely so
 * that applications never see it, and Aurora currently demands the opposite: the
 * only way in is to paste an nsec, which then sits in clear text in
 * profiles.json. This interface is what lets the key live somewhere else.
 *
 * Everything here is ASYNC, because a signer is: an Amber signature is an Android
 * intent the user has to approve, and a bunker signature is a websocket round
 * trip to another machine. Code that signs must be able to wait, or to queue (see
 * signing_outbox.dart). [LocalSigner] is the exception in practice — it answers
 * immediately — but it implements the same async contract so that no caller has
 * to care which kind it is holding.
 *
 * What a signer CANNOT do, and why the app still holds a key:
 *
 *   A signer signs NOSTR events and does NIP-04. It cannot produce the 48-byte
 *   truncated Schnorr the chat wapp puts on every frame (XprsCrypto.sign), nor the
 *   custom ECDH+AES envelope Circles uses, nor hand raw scalar material to the
 *   coin wallet. Those keep using a locally-generated DEVICE key, which the
 *   signer cross-certifies once. See the plan (docs/plan-nostr-signer.md) and
 *   IwiProfile.devicePriv.
