/// guarded API — BLE scan/advertise, GPS, a foreground-service notification.
/// The boot orchestrator runs BEFORE runApp(), so services started there fired
/// those dialogs at a user who had been told nothing, *before our own
/// permissions intro had even rendered*. Creating a profile then started the
/// same services and produced a second wave of prompts, this time after the
/// callsign screen. Both are the same bug: a service reaching for a permission
/// on its own schedule instead of ours.
///
/// So every service that can trigger a system prompt starts HERE, and only
/// once [ready] is true. The intro screen is then the single place a permission
/// dialog can come from, which is the whole point of having an intro screen.
