/*
 * mesh_store — the street-mesh store-and-forward archive (docs/mesh.md §6).
 *
 * Every custody node archives the 1:1 messages it carries. SQLite (WAL) for
 * the same reason as media_archive.dart: atomic writes, a crash can't shred
 * the file, one corrupt row never costs the store.
 *
 *   mesh_store    — parked/carried messages, keyed by their am: receipt id
 *                   (or a content-hash pseudo-key 'c:<fnv>' when a frame has
 *                   no am). state 0 = in-transit (we still owe delivery),
 *                   state 1 = archive (custody handed over / e2e-acked).
 *   received_ams  — ids WE received recently; source of the beacon
 *                   have-digest bloom and the inbound duplicate check.
 *   bulk_handover — 7-day records of bulk files we passed downstream
 *                   (dup suppression after the .part is deleted).
 *
 * Quota: 7 days OR the message quota (default 100 MB), whichever first —
 * sweep drops expired rows, then archives oldest-first, then in-transit
 * lowest-urgency-oldest-first ([MeshUrgency]).
