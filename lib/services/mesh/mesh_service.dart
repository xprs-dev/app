/*
 * mesh_service — the BLE street-mesh node (docs/mesh.md, milestone M1).
 *
 * Owns the mesh control plane: builds and airs this node's route beacon on
 * the shared BLE5 extended-advert bus (subtype 0x4D) and ingests neighbors'
 * beacons into the distance-vector table. M1 scope: see the street — no data
 * plane yet (custody transfer/SCF land in M2, politeness/scoring in M3).
 *
 * Beacon cadence: a fixed base interval, plus one early "triggered update"
 * (debounced) when the table reports a topology change, so 2-hop routes
 * converge in seconds instead of a full beacon period. Scan-only devices
 * (no extended advertising, e.g. C61) run everything except the transmit —
 * they are leaves: they see the street but the street can't route via them.
