/*
 * mesh_table — neighbor registry + distance-vector routing table
 * (docs/mesh.md §4).
 *
 * Fed exclusively by received route beacons. Android hears adverts in batched
 * bursts with gaps of tens of seconds, so nothing here reacts to a single
 * sighting or a single miss: neighbors age out only after kNeighborTtl of
 * silence, and the contact ratio is an EWMA over sightings, not a boolean.
 *
 * Routing rules implemented (classic RIP guards):
 *  - learn dest→(via N, cost+1) when better than what we hold;
 *  - routes THROUGH a neighbor die with that neighbor's beacon (aging);
 *  - a neighbor is usable as a next-hop only when the link is confirmed
 *    bidirectional — N's own DV digest lists US at cost 1 (asymmetric BLE
 *    links are common and a one-way neighbor is a black hole);
 *  - cost is capped at kMeshMaxCost (6): dv entries that would exceed it are
 *    not exported (DV "infinity").
 *
 * Split horizon happens at export time: [exportDv] takes the neighbor the
 * digest is being offered to and omits every route learned via that neighbor.
 * (The broadcast beacon serves all neighbors at once, so its digest can't be
 * per-neighbor — instead receivers ignore entries that point back at
 * themselves, which [ingest] does by skipping our own hash.)
