/*
 * mesh_frame — one view over the two frame formats in flight.
 *
 * We emit XPRS (docs/XPRS.md). We still have to *read* the compact
 * `FROM \x1F TO \x1F text` frame, because the chat wapp and the ESP32 dongle
 * both still speak it and custody sees every advert on the air. Reading both
 * while emitting one is what makes the changeover survivable: nothing that
 * works today stops working the day XPRS starts transmitting.
 *
 * The legacy half of this file is scaffolding. It comes out when the wapp and
 * the dongle are ported, and nothing above it has to change when it does.
