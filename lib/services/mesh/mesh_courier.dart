/*
 * MeshCourier — the core's store-and-forward lane.
 *
 * Delivery is a transport problem, not a chat feature. When the core cannot
 * reach a destination directly, it hands a copy to whatever device is nearby
 * and lets the mesh carry it (docs/mesh.md §6). Wapps do not participate: they
 * hand the core a message, and the core calls them back when one arrives.
 *
 * Two halves:
 *
 *   OUT  [arm] every 1:1 the core sends. Twenty seconds later, if the message
 *        is still sitting in the retry queue, there is no working path — a peer
 *        on the LAN or reachable through a hub acknowledges in well under a
 *        second — so a compact copy goes on the air for any custodian to hold.
 *        Deciding up front does not work: the observed-node list calls a device
 *        "seen" because a hub replayed its announce cache, and a learned path
 *        outlives the peer that taught it by hours. Both were measured against
 *        a phone with its radios switched off.
 *
 *   IN   frames addressed to us — overheard on air or handed over an MSP
 *        session by a custodian — are verified, decrypted, and injected into
 *        the LXMF inbox as though they had arrived over Reticulum. The wapp
 *        that owns the conversation renders it through the path it already
 *        uses; nothing about custody reaches it.
 *
 * Wire: XPRS (docs/XPRS.md).
 *
 *   t:message f:FROM d:TO ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 sig:<60> m:body
 *   t:message f:FROM d:TO ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 x:<sealed> sig:<60>
 *
 * The envelope is deliberately public — a carrier that cannot read who a
 * message is for cannot decide whom to hand it to — while the body is sealed to
 * the recipient's key whenever we hold one.
 *
 * Three fields of the old compact frame are gone. `am:` because the identifier
 * is derived from the packet (section 5), so nothing announces its own id and a
 * relayed copy keeps the one it was born with. `sd:` because the sender's LXMF
 * address is a pure function of their public key, which is safer than trusting
 * an address written on the wire by whoever sent it. `np:` because a sealed
 * body already proves who the copy is for.
 *
 * We EMIT only XPRS. We still READ the compact frame (see mesh_frame.dart),
 * because the chat wapp and the ESP32 dongle still speak it and custody sees
 * every advert on the air. That half goes away when they are ported.
