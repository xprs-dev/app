/*
 * BackgroundService — shared template for recurring background work.
 *
 * Every periodic service (wapp tick loops, autostarted/boot services, …)
 * should run through this so it is uniformly:
 *   - visible in the TaskMonitor (the "tasks" wapp) with a stable id/name,
 *   - assigned a priority (so the governor can shed low-priority load),
 *   - CPU-measured per tick (lastDuration / totalCpuMs / cpuBudgetEma), and
 *   - pause-aware: the monitor's governor auto-pauses a runaway tick so one
 *     misbehaving service can't starve the UI or other services.
 *
 * Threading: set [runsInIsolate] for pure-compute services and offload the
 * heavy work inside [onTick] via [runOffThread] (Isolate.run) so it runs on
 * its own thread and never blocks the UI isolate. Services that must touch
 * main-isolate plugins (e.g. BLE) keep it false and rely on the governor.
