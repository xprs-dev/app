/*
 * xprs_monitor — what this device has heard on the air, kept so a person can
 * look at it.
 *
 * Passive and read-only. It decides nothing, transmits nothing and is on no
 * delivery path: the transport has already handled a packet by the time it
 * lands here. That is what keeps it on the right side of "transports are core"
 * — it observes, it does not route.
 *
 * Two things are exposed to a wapp (docs/XPRS.md section 10.6):
 *
 *   stations — who has been heard, over which bearer, how recently
 *   traffic  — the last few hundred packets, including the ones addressed to
 *              other people, which is most of what a mesh carries
 *
 * INTERNET TRAFFIC NEVER ENTERS THIS RING, and not by filtering it out later.
 * The bearer is recorded where the packet arrives, only radio and local
 * bearers call [offer], and [kBearers] refuses anything else. A packet that
 * came over a hub cannot be in here to be leaked by a caller who forgot.
