/*
 * rns_autostart — make the Reticulum node always-on.
 *
 * The node must run automatically with no manual step: folder sharing,
 * folder discovery by key, and file transfer all depend on it. This wires the
 * serve source + persistent store paths exactly like POST /api/rns/start and
 * then connects to a public Reticulum testnet TCP bootstrap as a client.
 *
 * It is idempotent (a no-op when the node is already up/starting) and honours
 * the rnsAutoStart preference so the user can opt out. The bootstrap host/port
 * are configurable (PreferencesService.rnsBootstrapHost/Port); the default is a
 * live public testnet hub.
