///    hours, the coverage region. No Android API reports that there is a solar
///    panel on the roof or a LoRa hat on the windowsill, and pretending to
///    infer it would be a lie with a battery attached.
///
/// A node announces FACTS and never a self-assessment — there is no "I am
/// precious" field. Every asker scores what it hears for itself, and what we
/// have *observed* about a peer always beats what the peer *claimed*.
