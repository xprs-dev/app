/// "To touch it is to keep it" — the host half of the touch rule
/// (docs/NOSTR.md, *The bridge*).
///
/// A like is not a fleeting gesture: it is a statement that this thing mattered.
/// So when the user likes, replies to, reposts, bookmarks or zaps an event, the
/// EVENT is archived here — the note itself, its author's profile, the thread
/// above a reply, and its pictures — at tier 0, on this device's own relay, and
/// served from there over Reticulum. The public relay it came from can then rot,
/// go paid or vanish, and nothing the user cared about goes with it.
///
/// ## Where the work runs (docs/performance.md)
///
/// Nothing expensive happens on the UI isolate, and the two rules that keep it
/// that way are not negotiable:
///
/// 1. **Signature verification stays in the `nostr-engine` isolate.** A keep
///    often has to *fetch* a note (and its parents) that this device never held.
///    Those fetches go through the engine — it owns the relays and the
///    secp256k1 — and come back already verified, so the main isolate stores
///    them with [RelayEventStore.putAllVerified] and never runs Schnorr. Calling
///    `put()` here would put secp256k1 back on the UI thread: the exact pattern
///    that once froze the app for hours (§3.1).
/// 2. **Nothing blocks, ever.** [keep] enqueues and returns. A timer drains a
///    few items per tick; the store work per item is a handful of indexed
///    lookups and a primary-key UPDATE. Media is fetched over the network with
///    a size cap and a bounded number in flight.
///
/// The queue is **persisted**, so a keep survives the app being backgrounded or
/// killed mid-flight: the headless engine that already runs the background
/// wapps and RnsService picks the queue up and finishes it. A user who liked
/// something on a train, in a tunnel, still has it when they get home.
