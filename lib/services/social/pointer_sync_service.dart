/// The Indexer↔Indexer sync scheduler (docs/NOSTR.md).
///
/// Indexers spread the map among themselves so the phones do not have to.
/// Indexer-to-indexer traffic is fast and wired; a phone's is neither. So:
///
/// **Battery-powered leaves are never sync partners.** They announce, they get
/// indexed, and they are left alone. That asymmetry is the whole reason the
/// Indexer role exists — without it, "everyone is a relay" means "everyone's
/// battery pays for everyone else's queries".
///
/// This device only *runs* the loop when it is itself an Indexer (plugged in,
/// on a real uplink — `RelayRoleManager` derives that from the hardware, not
/// from a wish), and it only *talks to* peers whose announce says they are
/// Indexers too.
///
/// ## Performance (docs/performance.md)
///
/// Everything here is network-bound and off the UI's critical path: one peer per
/// tick, one bounded batch per exchange, and the RNS link work already lives in
/// the transport isolate. The merge verifies each record — which is Ed25519 over
/// a 176-byte record, not secp256k1 over a note — and is bounded by the batch
/// size (64), so a round is a few milliseconds of crypto, not a firehose.
