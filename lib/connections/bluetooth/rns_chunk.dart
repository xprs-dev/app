// Splitting one Reticulum packet across several BLE adverts, and putting it
// back together.
//
// A BLE 5 extended advert carries whatever THIS controller allows — often
// ~230 B, sometimes less — while an RNS announce with app_data runs to 250 B
// and more. The BLE5 radio is broadcast-only, so an over-cap packet had no path
// at all: it was counted, logged and dropped, which is why two devices with
// nothing but Bluetooth between them never heard each other's announces.
//
// Fragments ride their OWN advert subtype (Ble5Subtype.rnsChunk), so a fragment
// can never be mistaken for a whole packet, and never reaches the APRS
// reassembler — that one speaks different framing entirely.
//
// Wire format, per fragment:
//   [0] src     sender session id — random once per radio, see below
//   [1] msgId   sender-chosen, wraps at 256 — groups fragments of one packet
//   [2] idx     0-based fragment index
//   [3] total   fragment count (1..255)
//   [4..] payload slice
//
// The sender id is in the frame because the ADVERTISER ADDRESS CANNOT BE USED:
// Android rotates the BLE random MAC, so two fragments of one packet routinely
// arrive under different addresses. Keying reassembly on the address meant a
// multi-fragment packet — which every LXMF envelope is — never completed, and
// the half was swept away 20 s later without a word.
//
// There is no retransmit: an announce is periodic by nature, so the next one
// repairs a loss. Incomplete sets are dropped after [kRnsChunkTtl] rather than
// held forever.
