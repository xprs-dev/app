/*
 * Platform abstraction — web stubs.
 *
 * This file is selected by `platform.dart` on every target that does
 * NOT have `dart.library.io` (i.e. Flutter web). Every function here
 * has a no-op / default implementation so the rest of the codebase
 * can call through without knowing which platform it's running on.
 *
 * The native equivalent lives in `platform_io.dart` and uses
 * Platform/Process/File/Directory. Keep the signatures in sync.
