/// Folder names always auto-installed on first run, on top of every
/// `kind: "system"` wapp. Keeps the default set in one place.
/// Never seeded, whatever else says otherwise.
///
/// THREE passes install wapps, each selecting differently, and each one leaks
/// a wapp the others would have caught: the filesystem sweep takes anything
/// declaring `kind: "system"`; the asset sweep takes EVERY bundled `.wapp`
/// with no filter at all; and upgradeBundledWapps installs any bundled wapp
/// that is not already present, on every boot. One list, checked in all
/// three -- a name removed from only one of them comes back.
///
///  - `app-creator` is the wapp editor, installed to its own location and
///    reached through each wapp's Edit action; it was never a grid tile.
///  - `install` is the Wapp Store, hidden until it is finished. It ships in
///    assets/ and declares `kind: "system"`, so it slipped through both
///    sweeps until each was told about it by name.

/// the data dir that holds its history and settings, its autostart preference,
/// and its entry in the two offered-sets. So a rename that only swaps the
/// bundled `.wapp` would leave the old install (and its history) orphaned and
/// install the new one as a stranger.
///
/// Moves all four:
///   - program dir  `wapps/<old>`      -> `wapps/<new>`
///   - data dir     `data/<old>`       -> `data/<new>`   (history + settings)
///   - preference   `wapp.autostart.*`
///   - offered-sets `.seed_offered.json` / `.seeded.json` — without these,
///     [upgradeBundledWapps] would treat the renamed bundle as a first-time
///     addition and reinstall it even for a user who deliberately uninstalled
///     the wapp under its old name.
///
/// Idempotent: a no-op once `<new>` exists / `<old>` is gone. Runs before
/// seeding + the bundled-wapp upgrade, so the renamed install then upgrades to
/// the new bundle (new id/title/icon).
