/*
 * DependencyResolver — decides whether a wapp's declared `requires`
 * are satisfiable on this host before it is launched.
 *
 * The model is install-driven: a wapp does not bundle its dependencies,
 * it declares them, and the user installs other wapps that provide them.
 * This resolver is the gate that turns an unmet declaration into a
 * "prompt to install" instead of a silent runtime failure.
 *
 * Three kinds of requirement are checked:
 *   - requires.functionalities → satisfied when at least one installed
 *     wapp registers as a provider in [FunctionalityRegistry].
 *   - requires.libraries → satisfied when a wapp with that exact id is
 *     installed (library wapps are matched by id, called via hal_lib_call).
 *   - requires.hal → satisfied when the tag maps to a HAL capability the
 *     runtime knows about (coreFunctionalities). Only truly-unknown tags
 *     are flagged; a tag the runtime defines is considered host business.
 *
 * Pure / no Flutter deps so it can be unit-tested in isolation.
