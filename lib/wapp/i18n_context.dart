/*
 * I18nContext — per-wapp translation lookup.
 *
 * Every running wapp gets its own context that holds:
 *   - the active locale tag (e.g. `pt_PT`)
 *   - the primary translation map loaded from
 *     `lang/<locale>.json` inside the wapp package
 *   - a fallback map loaded from `lang/en.json` so keys that the
 *     primary locale hasn't translated yet still render in English
 *     rather than as a raw `@key`
 *
 * GeoUI-level strings (labels, tips, hints, defaults, label-block
 * text) and wapp-side strings (via `hal_i18n_get`) both flow through
 * [resolve]. Anything not starting with `@` is returned untouched,
 * so legacy wapps with hard-coded English pass through at zero cost.
 *
 * Phase 1 (docs/plan/wapp-i18n.md) ships:
 *   - this class
 *   - a loader that scans the wapp's `lang/` dir
 *   - integration into GeoUiScreenRenderer + WappEngine + WappPage
