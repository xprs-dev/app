/*
 * Central resolution of geogram storage roots. Every ProfileStorage instance
 * in iwi/lib/ should be obtained through this file so there is exactly one
 * place that knows the on-disk layout.
 *
 * Layout under the user home:
 *
 *   ~/.local/share/aurora/
 *     profiles.json             ← ProfileService state (list + active id)
 *     devices/<id>/
 *       wapps/<wapp-id>/        ← installed wapp packages (manifest, app.wasm, screens…)
 *       data/<wapp-id>/         ← each wapp's own data/settings (kv.json, hal_file_*)
 *
 * So `wapps/` holds the programs and `data/` holds their per-wapp
 * settings — two different things, one folder each. Every path below
 * resolves through the active ProfileService profile, so switching
 * profiles switches which `wapps/` and `data/` folders the launcher sees.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: aurora stores under ~/.local/share/aurora — NOT
 * ~/.local/share/geogram. The geogram dir belongs to the separate, real
 * geogram app and holds the user's real data; aurora must never read,
 * write, or delete there. (The old iwi fork wrongly pointed here at
 * geogram's dir; that is fixed.)
