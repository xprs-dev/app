# Chat rooms: NIP-72 communities with moderation and reputation

The Chat wapp models rooms as **NIP-72 moderated communities** plus a custom,
npub-signed **moderation op-log**, all reduced client-side. Rooms federate to any
standard NOSTR relay: a room is a plain kind-34550 community, room messages are
ordinary kind-1 notes tagged to it, and a non-xprs client simply ignores our
custom op kind. All of this lives in the wapp (`wapps/chat/room.c` + `room.h`);
the host stays generic (only its existing `hal_nostr_*`, `hal_sqlite_*`,
`hal_crypto_*` HALs are used).

Status: **Phase 1 shipped** (main room, roles, moderation, reputation, open
rooms). **Phase 2 shipped** (user-created sub-rooms with an approval flow, see
below). Phase 3 (members-only
rooms) are planned.

**A second, incompatible design for the same problem exists on paper.**
[XPRS.md](XPRS.md) section 26 specifies closed groups for the packet radio
format: the group holds its own keypair and is addressed by the `X5` callsign
derived from it, authority is rooted in that key rather than in the author of a
kind-34550 event, membership is a log of signed `t:moderate` grants, and
succession is handing the group's private key over. None of it is implemented.

The two differ on more than encoding, so anyone building Phase 3 should read it
before choosing: rooms here have no roster at all, take their global admin from
a compile-time `ROOM_MAIN_ADMIN`, and have no message-removal op; section 26 has
a roster, a cryptographic root of trust that needs no pinned constant, and
`hide:message`.

**The sub-room trees are the sharpest disagreement, and it is not cosmetic.**
Both designs nest. Here, authority flows *down*: `room_has_authority` walks
`parentRoomId` to the root (`wapps/chat/room.c:248-267`), so a global mod
moderates every room beneath them, and a room's admin moderates its descendants.
In section 26 a subgroup is an ordinary group with its own keypair, listed by
its parent with `grant:<X5> role:sub`, and **listing confers nothing**: the
parent cannot grant, revoke or hide inside the subgroup, because those acts are
signed by the subgroup's own key and nothing else verifies. Membership does not
travel down either.

Neither is obviously right. A walked tree gives a community one place to deal
with abuse anywhere beneath it; independent keys mean a compromised parent
cannot touch its children, and a subgroup can be handed to somebody else by
handing over one key. Choosing between them is choosing whether a parent
administers its children or merely names them, and it should be decided
deliberately rather than inherited from whichever code was written first. Nothing here needs to change today, and nothing here should be
extended toward members-only rooms without deciding which of the two models the
wapp is implementing.

## Events

| Purpose | Kind | Key tags |
|---|---|---|
| Room definition | **34550** (NIP-72) | `d`=roomId, `name`, `description`, `p`=moderator (`["p",pub,"","moderator"]`), `a`=parent (`34550:<parentAdmin>:<parentId>`) for a sub-room, `access`=`open`\|`members` |
| Room message | **1** | `a`=`34550:<admin>:<roomId>`, `h`=roomId |
| Moderation op | **9078** (custom) | `h`=roomId (or `*` for a wapp-wide ban), `p`=target, `op`, `until`, `amount`, `client`=`xprs-chat` |
| Sub-room proposal | **9079** (custom) | `h`=parentRoomId, `name`, `client`=`xprs-chat` |
| Sub-room approval | **9080** (custom) | `e`=proposalId, `h`=parentRoomId, `client`=`xprs-chat` |

`op` is one of `kick`, `suspend`, `unsuspend`, `ban`, `close`, `award`, `deduct`,
`promote`, `demote`. Content of a 9078 is the optional reason. 9078/9079/9080 are
regular events (relays keep them, unknown clients ignore them); they sit above
NIP-29's 9000-9022 admin range to avoid colliding with relay-enforced groups.

The **main room** is the tree root; its `d`=`main` and its author is the
**global admin**. That 34550 is published by whoever runs the project (its key is
`ROOM_MAIN_ADMIN` in `room.h`). During bring-up, with no project key configured,
the running device becomes the global admin so moderation is testable — replace
`ROOM_MAIN_ADMIN` before release.

## Authority (subtree-scoped)

Rooms form a tree by their `a`/parent link. Authority over room R is held by:

- the **global admin** (main-room author) and **global mods** (main-room `p`
  moderators) — authority over everything; and
- the **admin or a mod of R or of any ancestor of R** — a sub-admin (a room's
  author) and its sub-mods run that room and its descendants only.

`room_has_authority(pub, roomId)` walks `parentRoomId` from the room up to the
root and checks each level. The moderation reducer (`reduce`/`member_status`)
honours a 9078 op **only if its author has authority over the room the op names**,
so a forged op from a non-authority is ignored by every client.

Moderation effects (client-enforced soft gating; relays still store everything):
suspend-until hides the member's compose until the timestamp; a room `ban` hides
their posts and blocks compose in that room; a wapp-wide `ban` (`h=*`, global
authority only) hides them everywhere; `close` (global/ancestor authority) drops
the sub-room and its descendants from the tree.

## Sub-rooms with approval (Phase 2)

Anyone may ask for a sub-room; a **parent authority** must sanction it. The flow
keeps a sub-room from existing (visibly) unless a moderator of its parent — or an
ancestor, or a global admin/mod — approved it, while staying pure NOSTR:

1. **Propose.** `room_propose(parent, name)`: if the proposer already has
   authority over the parent the room is created immediately (no round-trip);
   otherwise a **9079** proposal is published (`h`=parent, `name`).
2. **Prompt.** A node that ingests a 9079 and holds authority over the parent gets
   `room_ingest → 3`, and the wapp surfaces an approve/dismiss prompt.
3. **Approve.** `room_approve(proposalId)` publishes a **9080** (`e`=proposalId,
   `h`=parent) — allowed only if the approver has parent authority.
4. **Create.** The original proposer, on ingesting the 9080, publishes the
   sub-room **34550** with **itself as admin** (it becomes the sub-admin) and the
   **approver added as a `["p",pub,"","moderator"]`**, carrying an
   `["approved",<9080 id>]` tag as the proof of sanction.

**Validity gate.** A root room is always valid. A sub-room 34550 is *verified*
only if its author already had authority over the parent, **or** it carries an
`approved` tag whose 9080 was signed by a parent authority. An unverified room is
stored `verified=0` and hidden from the rail. Because events can arrive in any
order, the 9080 ingest **re-verifies** (`UPDATE rooms SET verified=1 WHERE
approvedBy=<9080 id>`) independently of whether that node ever saw the 9079 — so a
node holding only the room def and the approval still un-hides the room. A
duplicate 9080 is idempotent (the proposal's `pending`→`published` status guards
the one-time publish, and `verified` is already 1).

Local state lives in two tables — `proposals(id, parentRoomId, proposerPub, name,
description, ts, status)` and `approvals(id, proposalId, approverPub, ts)` — plus
the `verified` column on `rooms`.

## Reputation (global, level 1-10)

Computed client-side, deterministically, so anyone replaying the same public
events gets the same number — no authority, relay-agnostic. Per pubkey:

```
score = REP_W_MSG * (their room messages in the trailing ~6 months)
        + net points (awards − deducts from honoured ops)
level = 1 + (number of REP_THRESH crossed), capped at 10
```

Weights (`REP_W_MSG`), the 6-month window (`REP_WINDOW_SEC`) and the level curve
(`REP_THRESH`) are one constants block in `room.c`; adjust there. (A reactions
term is reserved for a later phase.)

## Storage (device-local, `rooms.sqlite3`)

`rooms(roomId, adminPub, name, description, parentRoomId, access, approvedBy,
closed, verified, createdTs)` (a tree), `room_mods(roomId, pub)`, `ops(id, roomId,
authorPub, targetPub, op, amount, until, reason, ts)` (dedup by event id),
`msgs(id, roomId, author, ts)` (for the reputation window),
`proposals(id, parentRoomId, proposerPub, name, description, ts, status)` and
`approvals(id, proposalId, approverPub, ts)` (Phase 2). Kept on the device;
nothing about moderation state or reputation is a private secret — it is all a
pure reduction of public events.

## Wapp integration

`main.c` subscribes to `{kinds:[34550,9078,9079,9080]}` plus `{kinds:[1],#h:[rooms]}`,
feeds each event to `room_ingest` (defs/ops/proposals/approvals) or renders it as a
room message; a conversation whose id is a known room posts through `room_post`
(kind-1 with the `a`/`h` tags) instead of the APRS/BLE path. `room_ingest` returns
**2** when the tree changed (refresh the rail and re-subscribe so the new room's
kind-1 is covered), **3** when a proposal this user can approve arrived (surface
the approval prompt), **1** for any other consumed event, **0** for a non-room
event. The room list is the Discord rail (`ui.rooms.set`, sub-rooms indented); the
**Members** panel is a `people` list showing each member's status and reputation
level, and an authority tapping a member gets a moderation prompt
(award/deduct/suspend/kick/ban).

> **The approval flow is dormant until a real `ROOM_MAIN_ADMIN` is pinned.** During
> bring-up every device auto-adopts its own key as the global admin, so
> `room_propose` always finds authority and creates rooms directly — the 9079/9080
> handshake only engages once one designated project key is the global admin and
> other participants are not. Configure `ROOM_MAIN_ADMIN` (and publish the main-room
> 34550 from that key) to activate it.

## UI (Discord-like)

The Chat wapp renders through a generic host widget `$type:"rooms"`
(`lib/wapp/geoui/widgets/rooms_field.dart`, wired by `_buildRoomsScreen` in
`wapp_page.dart`): a thin left icon rail of rooms that expands on a left→right
drag into room names + the nested sub-room tree (with a `+` to create a room and
a bottom gear to Settings), the chat pane in the center, and a member list that
slides in from the right showing each member's reputation level (tap a member as
an authority for the moderation actions). On a phone the rail and member panel
overlay the chat with a tap-to-close scrim; on wide screens all three panes sit
side by side. The widget is app-agnostic — the wapp drives it with `ui.rooms.set`
(the rail), the usual `ui.convo.*` (chat), and `ui.people.set` (members), and
handles `rooms_open` / `rooms_send` / `rooms_new` / `rooms_settings` /
`room_members_tap`.
