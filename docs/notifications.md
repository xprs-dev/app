# Notifications

How any wapp or host code raises a notification in xprs, and how notifications
travel from an in-app card all the way to an OS-level toast on the desktop or Android.

> **Not covered here:** the Activity feed (`lib/wapp/geoui/widgets/activity_feed.dart`)
> is a Twitter/X-style social micro-blog stream. Despite the name overlap it is **not**
> part of the notification pipeline — it displays social posts and reports user gestures
> back to its wapp via callbacks; it never calls `NotificationService`. Don't conflate them.

## TL;DR

- **One entry point:** `NotificationService.instance.show(XPRSNotification(...))`.
- **From a wapp:** send an outbox message `{"type":"notify", ...}` via `hal_msg_send`.
  There is no dedicated `hal_notify` symbol — `notify` is a message *type*.
- **Severity:** `info | success | warning | error`.
- **Reach:** `scope: app | system | both` decides whether it stays in-app or escalates
  to the OS (system tray on Linux/macOS, `NotificationManager` on Android).
- **Dedupe:** set a `tag`; a given tag is shown **once, ever — across restarts**
  (persisted per profile by `AnnouncedTagsStore`).

## Architecture

```
wapp C code
  hal_msg_send('{"type":"notify","level":"warning","title":"...","scope":"both"}')
      │  (WasmImport 'hal'.'msg_send' → wapp_engine._outbox)
      ▼
host drains the wapp outbox:
  foreground wapp → wapp_page._drainOutbox        (scope respected)
  headless  wapp  → BackgroundWappManager         (scope forced to 'both')
      ▼
NotificationService.instance.show(XPRSNotification)      lib/services/notification_service.dart
  ├─ dedupe by tag, append to in-memory history (cap 200)
  ├─ fire NotificationShownEvent on the EventBus
  │     ├─ NotificationLayer  → in-app stacking overlay      (scope app|both)
  │     └─ NotificationStore  → persist + unreadCount → bell badge / NotificationsPage
  └─ SystemTrayNotificationBackend                           (scope system|both)
         → platform.showSystemNotification
             ├─ Linux  : notify-send
             ├─ macOS  : osascript display notification
             ├─ Android: MethodChannel bg_service 'notify' → BgBridge → NotificationManager
             ├─ Windows: not implemented (planned: winrt toast)
             └─ Web    : no-op
```

The whole system lives behind one service. Every path — wapp, host code, or an error on
the EventBus — funnels through `NotificationService.instance.show(...)`.

## The data model

`lib/services/notification_service.dart`

```dart
enum NotificationLevel { info, success, warning, error }   // severity
enum NotificationScope { app, system, both }               // reach; app is the default

class XPRSNotification {
  final NotificationLevel level;
  final String title;
  final String? body;
  final String source;    // "wapp:<wappName>" or "host:<service>"  (see convention below)
  final String? tag;      // dedupe key: a tag is shown once, ever
  final NotificationScope scope;
  final DateTime timestamp;
}
```

**`source` convention:** wapp-sourced notifications use `wapp:<wappName>`, host-sourced
use `host:<service>`. The notification center filters on these prefixes (a `wapp` chip and
a `host` chip), so follow the convention or your notification won't group correctly.

## Types of notifications

### By severity — `NotificationLevel`

| Level     | Meaning                | Desktop/Android treatment                                  |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `info`    | neutral status         | in-app card auto-dismiss 3 s; normal OS priority           |
| `success` | operation completed    | in-app card auto-dismiss 3 s                               |
| `warning` | something needs a look  | in-app card, warning color/icon                            |
| `error`   | failure                | in-app card auto-dismiss 6 s; Linux `notify-send --urgency=critical`; Android posts with the error flag |

String parsing accepts aliases: `warn` → `warning`, `err` → `error`. Unknown → `info`.

### By reach — `NotificationScope`

| Scope    | In-app overlay | Persisted + bell badge | OS system notification |
|----------|:--------------:|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|
| `app`    | ✅ (default)    | ✅                      | ❌                      |
| `system` | ❌              | ✅                      | ✅                      |
| `both`   | ✅              | ✅                      | ✅                      |

- `app` (default): shows the in-app stacking overlay card and lands in the notification
  center + bell badge. Never touches the OS.
- `system`: **escalates only to the OS** (tray/Android). Deliberately skipped by the in-app
  overlay so you don't get a card *and* a toast for the same thing.
- `both`: in-app card **and** OS notification. Use when the user might not be looking at
  the app.

> **Headless wapps always escalate.** A wapp running in the background (no visible page)
> can't draw an in-app card, so `BackgroundWappManager` forces `scope: both` on every
> `notify` it drains. That's how a background wapp reaches the user via an Android system
> notification even when the app UI isn't foregrounded.

### Android native channels

At the OS layer, Android sorts notifications into channels (each with its own importance
and user-facing settings). Package `com.xprs.app`:

| Channel id       | Label                  | Importance | Badges icon? | Used for                                          |
|------------------|------------------------|-----------|:---:|---------------------------------------------------|
| `aurora_events`  | "Messages & events"    | HIGH      | ✅  | the general `notify` escalation path (heads-up)   |
| `aurora_service` | "Background services"  | LOW       | ❌  | the ongoing foreground-service notification       |
| `aurora_updates` | "Updates"              | LOW       | ❌  | download/update progress (`DownloadForegroundService`) |
| `aurora_media`   | "Now playing"          | LOW       | ❌  | lock-screen media transport (Player wapp)         |

**Badge policy:** only `aurora_events` may put a dot on the launcher icon —
messages are news, everything else is status. The service and updates channels
were renamed (from `aurora_bg` / `aurora_download`) because channel settings
are immutable once created; the old ids are deleted on first run of the new
build. For general notifications only `aurora_events` matters — it's the
high-importance, heads-up channel `BgBridge` posts to, with ids cycling in
9000..9099 (service = 7001, download/media = 7002 — outside the sweep range).

### Unread badges are not notifications

Distinct mechanism, same outbox. A wapp can set an app-tile / header badge count without
raising a notification:

```json
{"type":"unread", "count": 3, "intent": "mail"}
```

This drives `WappUnreadService` (keyed by `wappId` and optional `intent`, e.g.
`wappId#mail`). Use `unread` for "there are N things" ambient counts; use `notify`
for "interrupt the user now".

**The base key and the intent keys are two VIEWS of one wapp's unread**, not
disjoint buckets — the host's conversation stores write the base key, the wapp's
own `unread` message writes its intent key. `totalFor` therefore takes the
larger of the two rather than adding them (adding made a tile read double), and
a host icon reads `badgeFor(wappId, intent)`, which falls back to the wapp's
total when that wapp publishes no intent key at all.

**A badge must be a number the user can act on.** A conversation the host
invented — one an inbound message created that the wapp never listed with
`ui.convo.upsert`, so no screen can render it — does not reach the app-wide
count, exactly like a `muted` one, and a `notify` naming it is dropped before it
reaches the bell, the shade or the badge. A wapp declares what is visible by
listing it; anything else asks for attention it cannot repay. A tile carrying a
badge also offers **Mark all read** in its long-press menu.

## Raising a notification from a wapp

Wapps are C programs compiled to WASM. They talk to the host by writing a JSON string to
the host outbox via the single host import `hal_msg_send`. To raise a notification, send a
message with `type: "notify"`:

```c
hal_msg_send(
  "{\"type\":\"notify\","
  "\"level\":\"warning\","
  "\"title\":\"Low battery\","
  "\"body\":\"Node X1 reports 12%\","
  "\"tag\":\"batt-x1\","          // optional dedupe key
  "\"scope\":\"both\"}"           // omit → defaults to "app"
);
```

Wire fields:

| Field   | Required | Values                                | Default |
|---------|:--------:|---------------------------------------|---------|
| `type`  | yes      | `"notify"`                            | —       |
| `title` | yes      | string                                | —       |
| `level` | no       | `info`/`success`/`warning`/`error`    | `info`  |
| `body`  | no       | string                                | —       |
| `tag`   | no       | string dedupe key (shown once ever, across restarts) | none |
| `scope` | no       | `app`/`system`/`both`                 | `app`   |
| `convo` | no       | conversation id inside the wapp — the TAP TARGET | none |

**`convo` makes the notification tappable.** When set, tapping the
notification — Android shade or in-app center, both — opens the source wapp
ON that conversation (`WappPage(initialConvo: …)`), not its front page. Mail
sets it to the peer's pubkey. A message notification without `convo` opens
the wapp's front page, which for a message is broken UX — always set it.

**Tag discipline.** Use a per-event, namespaced tag (`mail:<rmid>`, `batt-x1`),
never a constant: a constant tag ("msg") suppresses every later notification of
that kind FOREVER — the first one claims the tag and the announce guard is
persistent. Namespacing (`<wapp>:<event-id>`) also keeps two wapps from
colliding on the same raw tag.

The host sets `source` for you to `wapp:<wappName>` — don't send it yourself.

**Legacy `ui.toast`.** The older shape is still accepted and routed through the same
service as an `info`-level notification, so old wapps inherit tray delivery + history:

```json
{"type":"ui.toast", "message":"Saved"}
```

There is **no `hal_notify` C symbol.** The only host import is `hal.msg_send`; `notify`
is a message type, not a HAL function.

### Routing details

- **Foreground wapp:** `wapp_page._drainOutbox` parses the message and honors `scope` as
  sent (defaults to `app`).
- **Headless wapp:** `BackgroundWappManager` drains the outbox and forces `scope: both`
  (see the callout above) so background notifications always reach the OS.

## Raising a notification from host (Dart) code

Call the service directly, using the `host:<service>` source convention:

```dart
NotificationService.instance.show(XPRSNotification(
  level: NotificationLevel.error,
  title: 'Sync failed',
  body: 'Could not reach hub',
  source: 'host:folders',
  tag: 'folders-sync-fail',   // optional; shown once ever
  scope: NotificationScope.both,
));
```

**Automatic error surfacing.** `NotificationService.init()` subscribes to `ErrorEvent` on
the EventBus, so anything that fires an `ErrorEvent` auto-becomes an `error`-level
notification. You often don't need to raise error notifications by hand — fire the event.

## What the user sees

- **In-app overlay** — `NotificationLayer`: a stacking overlay of up to 5 cards, top-right.
  Not a SnackBar/ScaffoldMessenger (deliberate — it must survive route changes and stack).
  Auto-dismiss 3 s (info/success) / 6 s (error). `scope: system` cards are skipped here.
  Installed via `MaterialApp.builder`, not `home:`.
- **Bell + badge** — `home_header.dart` renders a badged bell bound to
  `NotificationStore.instance.unreadCount`. Opens the notification center.
- **Notification center** — `NotificationsPage`: full-screen list, grouped by day
  (Today / Yesterday / date), filter chips for `all` / `wapp` / `host` and one per level.
  Opening it marks all seen — and so does closing it, because anything that
  arrived while it was open was recorded unseen under the user's eyes. Marking
  seen ALSO cancels the app's event notifications
  in the Android shade (`platform.clearSystemNotifications()` → `BgBridge`
  `notify_clear`), so the shade and the launcher-icon dot always agree with
  the center. Rows are tappable by `source`: `wapp:<folder>` opens that wapp —
  on the row's `convo` when it has one — via `openWappByFolder`
  (`lib/wapp/wapp_open.dart`), the same helper the Android tap deep link uses;
  `host:updates` opens Settings; any other `host:*` row is inert.
- **Android tap deep link** — `BgBridge.notify` attaches
  `xprs://open?wapp=<folder>&convo=<id>` to the notification's tap intent;
  `MainActivity.linkFrom` accepts it and `DeepLinkService` routes it through
  the same `openWappByFolder`. One opener, two doors.
- **OS notification** — for `system`/`both`: `notify-send` (Linux), `osascript`
  (macOS), or a heads-up `NotificationManager` post (Android). Tapping the Android one
  opens the launcher.

## Persistence & dedupe

- **In-memory history:** `NotificationService.history`, rolling, capped at 200. Not
  persisted (survives only the process).
- **Persistent store:** `NotificationStore` writes to `notifications/history.jsonl` in the
  active profile (cap 300). Reloads on profile switch. Exposes `items` and
  `unreadCount` as `ValueNotifier`s.
- **Read state is per ROW** (`seen`), not a "everything before this time" cursor.
  A cursor has two moving operands: it advances when the list is opened, and a
  row's timestamp advances whenever a replayed event is re-recorded — so an
  already-read notification jumped back above the line and re-lit the bell. A
  flag cannot be un-set by a replay. A row written before the field existed has
  no `seen` and falls back to the legacy `notifications/seen_ms.txt` watermark,
  which is still maintained. A replayed row also inherits its predecessor's
  first-seen timestamp, so a repeat does not jump to "Today" — which makes
  `history.jsonl` a second dedupe guard, independent of the tag file.
- **Dedupe by `tag`:** `NotificationService.show` shows a given tag **once, ever, across
  restarts**. The announced set is persisted per profile by `AnnouncedTagsStore`
  (`notifications/announced.txt`, one tag per line, FIFO-capped at 4000): a replayed
  tagged event after a restart is dropped before it reaches any backend or the store —
  no resurrected unread count, no duplicate Android shade entry. Tag-less notifications
  bypass the guard entirely (transient status/errors). Tagged notifications that arrive
  before the guard has loaded are buffered and re-run through it once it is ready.
  In the persistent store, a repeated `tag` **replaces** the earlier row rather than
  stacking (the tag is used as the row id), inheriting its `seen` flag and
  first-seen time. `show()` returns whether the user was actually told, so
  anything mirroring a notification elsewhere (a launcher badge) can skip a
  suppressed duplicate. The announced set is written on a debounce that arms
  once rather than restarting — a burst faster than 1/s used to postpone the
  write forever, and a backlog replay is such a burst — and is flushed on the
  app's lifecycle pause edge, since Android kills a backgrounded process
  without warning.
- **Clear vs guard:** `NotificationStore.clear()` empties the visible history but does
  NOT clear the announced set — otherwise Clear would re-arm announcement of everything
  that replays on the next start.

## Muting a conversation (close = mute)

The Mail wapp treats **Close** as mute: the host sends `conversations_close`
(both the long-press sheet and the app-bar menu), the wapp persists the peer on
its closed list (KV `closed`) and from then on drops that peer's incoming
messages at ingest — before the store write and before `notify_new` — in both
the foreground and headless drains. No message, no notification, no unread.
Re-engaging uncloses it: opening the thread, sending to the peer (any device),
or a New message to their key; the wapp then emits `ui.convo.upsert` with
`closed:false` so the host's `ConversationStore` (which persisted the flag)
un-hides the thread. The host-side drop in `ConversationStore.addMessage`
remains as a backstop for messages already in flight.

## Platform support matrix

| Platform | System notification | Mechanism                                            |
|----------|:-------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Linux    | ✅                  | `notify-send` (`--urgency=critical` for errors)      |
| macOS    | ✅                  | `osascript -e 'display notification ...'`             |
| Android  | ✅                  | `MethodChannel` `com.xprs.app/bg_service` `notify` → `BgBridge` → `NotificationManager` (heads-up, channel "Messages & events") |
| Windows  | ❌                  | not implemented (planned: winrt toast)               |
| Web      | ❌                  | no-op                                                |

The in-app path (overlay + bell + center) works on **all** platforms, so `scope: app`
notifications are always delivered even where OS escalation isn't wired up. No
`flutter_local_notifications` dependency — all native delivery is hand-rolled.
