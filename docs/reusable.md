# geogram (iwi/) reusable components

Catalog of reusable libraries inside the geogram Flutter launcher (`iwi/`).
Each entry should describe what the component does, where it lives, and the
non-obvious constraints a future caller needs to know.

> The wider geogram repo has its own `../docs/reusable.md` covering the
> parent app's components. This file is scoped to `iwi/lib/` only.

> **Prefer the wapp layer to the core engine.** Updating a wapp is cheap — it
> ships as a small `.wapp` through the Wapp Store with no reinstall. Updating the
> core engine means a **whole new APK** the user must download and install (a signed
> Android update, versionCode bump, slow rollout). So new functionality belongs in a
> **wapp** unless it genuinely cannot: a new transport, a HAL primitive, or a
> cross-cutting host service that many wapps share. The services catalogued below
> exist precisely so a wapp can reuse them instead of forcing a change into the
> engine — reach for one of these (or add a *generic* one) before growing the core.
> App-specific logic (APRS/Chat conventions, social rules) never goes in `lib/`; it
> lives in the wapp's C + GeoUI. When in doubt, the change goes in the wapp.

## Storage

### ProfileStorage — filesystem abstraction

**Files:**
- `lib/services/profile_storage.dart` — `ProfileStorage` (abstract),
  `StorageEntry`, `FilesystemProfileStorage`, `ScopedProfileStorage`
- `lib/services/storage_paths.dart` — helpers that hand back ready-to-use
  storages: `geogramRootStorage()`, `installedAppsStorage()`,
  `wappsDataStorage(prefs)`, `wappDataStorageFor(prefs, wappId)`,
  `wappPackageStorage(absPath)`

**What it is.** Every filesystem operation in geogram (iwi) goes through
`ProfileStorage`. No `dart:io` `File` / `Directory` calls anywhere else in
`lib/` — that rule is enforced by code review and the analyser will catch
slips because the storage call sites do not import `dart:io`. The pillar
exists so that the backing store can be swapped for an encrypted SQLite
archive (encrypted profiles), a browser IndexedDB tree (web build), or a
plain filesystem (today's desktop) without touching call sites.

**API surface** (mirrors the parent repo's
`lib/services/profile_storage.dart` so a shared package can be extracted
later with a single import change):

- Async file ops: `readString`, `readBytes`, `writeString`, `writeBytes`,
  `appendString`, `exists`, `delete`, `copyFromExternal`, `copyToExternal`
- Async directory ops: `listDirectory`, `createDirectory`,
  `directoryExists`, `deleteDirectory`
- JSON convenience: `readJson`, `writeJson`
- **Sync variants for WASM HAL callbacks**: `readBytesSync`,
  `writeStringSync`, `writeBytesSync`, `existsSync`. These exist only
  because WASM imports run synchronously and Dart `Future`s cannot be
  awaited from inside them. `FilesystemProfileStorage` implements them
  with `dart:io` sync methods. **Non-sync backends** (encrypted SQLite,
  browser IndexedDB) **must throw** `UnsupportedError` for these — and
  callers must fall back to a message-based async API in that case.

**Storage layout under the user home:**

```
~/.local/share/geogram/
  apps/<wapp-id>/    extracted .wapp packages (installed wapps)
  wapps/<wapp-id>/   per-wapp runtime data (kv.json, future hal_file_*)
```

The previous "iwi" codename left data under `~/.local/share/iwi/`. There
is no auto-migration; copy manually if needed.

**How wapps use it.**

- `WappEngine.setStorage(ProfileStorage)` — call before `load()`. The
  engine persists KV via the storage's sync variants from inside HAL
  callbacks.
- `wappPackageStorage(wappDir)` — wrap any wapp package directory
  (built-in `wapps/archive/<name>/` or installed) and use it to read
  `manifest.json`, `app.wasm`, `screens/*.ui.json`, and `media/*`.
- `wappDataStorageFor(prefs, wappName)` — per-wapp scoped storage for
  KV + future `hal_file_*` writes.

**Open question — `hal_file_*` (currently stubbed in `wapp_engine.dart`).**
The HAL declares synchronous `hal_file_open/read/write/close`. On
`FilesystemProfileStorage` this could be implemented with the sync
variants, but that locks `hal_file_*` to native filesystem backends. The
alternative is to redesign `hal_file_*` to be async with polling
(matching `hal_http_*`), which works on every backend but requires
updating `wapps/hal/geogram_wasm_hal.h` and any wapp that touches files.
This decision is deferred until a real wapp needs file I/O on encrypted
or browser backends.

**Don't forget:**
- Use `ScopedProfileStorage(inner, 'subpath')` when a subsystem only
  needs a sub-tree — it auto-prefixes every operation and keeps call
  sites unaware of the absolute layout.
- For arbitrary external absolute paths (a user-typed source directory,
  for example) wrap the directory in a transient
  `FilesystemProfileStorage(absDir)` and use the basename as the
  relative path. Don't drop back to raw `File`.
- For tools like `unzip` that need a real on-disk path, use
  `storage.getAbsolutePath(rel)` to extract one — this works today
  because `installedAppsStorage()` is filesystem-backed. When an
  encrypted/IndexedDB backend lands the install flow will need to
  unzip into a temp dir then `copyFromExternal` each entry.

## Events

### EventBus — host-side type-safe broadcast bus

**File:** `lib/services/event_bus.dart`

**What it is.** Singleton broadcast channel for `AppEvent` subclasses.
Type-safe — `EventBus().on<MyEvent>(handler)` only fires for that
concrete type. Dispatch uses `event.runtimeType` so subclass events
route correctly even when fired via the base type. API mirrors parent
geogram's `lib/util/event_bus.dart`.

**Built-in events:**
- `AppStartedEvent` — fired once after launcher startup completes
  (after `_scanArchive` finishes). Background services that should run
  post-init subscribe to this.
- `WappLoadedEvent { wappId, wappName }` — wapp finished
  `module_init`.
- `WappUnloadedEvent { wappId, wappName }` — wapp page disposed.
- `WappCrashedEvent { wappId, phase, error }` — `phase` is `'load'`,
  `'init'`, `'tick'`, or `'handle_event'`.
- `WappEventBridgeEvent { fromEngineId, topic, data }` — bridged from
  the cross-wapp `WappEventBroker` so host observers can watch wapp
  pub/sub traffic.
- `ErrorEvent { source, message, error }` — generic error channel.
  `NotificationService` subscribes to this and auto-surfaces each
  `ErrorEvent` as an error-level notification.
- `NotificationShownEvent { notification }` — fired by
  `NotificationService.show` after a notification has been dispatched
  to backends. Use this to build a history / debug UI.

**Usage:**
```dart
final sub = EventBus().on<WappLoadedEvent>((e) {
  print('${e.wappName} loaded');
});
// ...later
sub.cancel();
```

Add new event types as subclasses of `AppEvent` directly in
`event_bus.dart` — keep them in one place so the catalogue is easy to
scan.

### WappEventBroker — cross-wapp pub/sub on top of `hal_event_*`

**File:** `lib/services/wapp_event_broker.dart`

**What it is.** Singleton router that backs the WASM HAL event
imports (`hal_event_subscribe`, `hal_event_unsubscribe`,
`hal_event_publish`, `hal_event_available`, `hal_event_recv`). Each
`WappEngine` registers itself with a stable `engineId` on
construction and unregisters on dispose; the broker holds
`{engineId → (subscribed topics, pending event queue)}`.

**Wire-up:** `WappEngine` constructor calls
`WappEventBroker.instance.registerEngine(engineId)`; the HAL function
imports in the engine's load() call into the broker. Already wired —
nothing for callers to do.

**Delivery model:**
- `publish(fromEngineId, topic, data)` fans out to every engine
  subscribed to the exact topic string (including the publisher
  itself if it subscribed). Each delivery appends a `_PendingEvent`
  to the recipient's queue.
- Wapps drain their own queue from inside `module_tick` /
  `module_handle_event` by polling `hal_event_available()` and then
  calling `hal_event_recv(topic_buf, topic_len, data_buf, data_len)`.
- The host can observe every published event by subscribing to
  `WappEventBridgeEvent` on the host `EventBus`.

**Backpressure:** each engine queue is capped at
`maxQueuePerEngine = 1024` events. When full, the **oldest** event is
dropped. Wapps that need lossless delivery must drain on every tick.

**Topic strings are exact-match.** No wildcards or hierarchy yet —
add later only if a real wapp needs it. Convention: dot-separated
namespacing (`chat.message.received`, `transfer.completed`).

**Don't forget:**
- Multiple wapp instances of the same wapp will get unique
  `engineId`s — the broker treats them independently. There is no
  per-wapp-name routing.
- The broker is **process-local**. Cross-process or cross-host event
  routing (mesh, BLE) is out of scope.

### HostEventBridge — host events → wapp topics

**File:** `lib/services/host_event_bridge.dart`

**What it is.** Subscribes to key host `AppEvent`s on `EventBus` and
republishes each one on `WappEventBroker` under a stable `system.*`
topic name. This is what lets wapps react to host-level events
(app started, wapp loaded, task failed, error fired) through the
normal `hal_event_subscribe` / `hal_event_recv` path — without this
bridge, host and wapp event namespaces would be fully isolated.

**Installed as a boot task.** `main.dart` registers
`HostEventBridge.instance.install()` as a `BootStart.parallel` task
on `BootOrchestrator`; once `runAll()` finishes the bridge is live.
Uninstall is only for tests.

**Bridged topics and payloads** (payloads are JSON strings):

| Topic                  | Fires when                              | Payload                                                             |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `system.app.started`   | launcher finishes boot (AppStartedEvent)| `{}`                                                                |
| `system.wapp.loaded`   | wapp finished `module_init`             | `{"wappId":"...","wappName":"..."}`                                 |
| `system.wapp.unloaded` | wapp page disposed                      | `{"wappId":"...","wappName":"..."}`                                 |
| `system.wapp.crashed`  | wapp threw during load/init/tick/event  | `{"wappId":"...","phase":"...","error":"..."}`                      |
| `system.error`         | `ErrorEvent` fired on host bus          | `{"source":"...","message":"..."}`                                  |

A wapp that wants to react to any of these calls
`hal_event_subscribe("system.wapp.loaded")` (or similar) and drains
events from `module_handle_event` / `module_tick` via
`hal_event_recv`. The `fromEngineId` on the bridged
`WappEventBridgeEvent` is always the literal string `"host"`.

**Working end-to-end example.** The **Tester** wapp
(`wapps/archive/tester/`) has an **Events** screen with buttons that
exercise every part of the pipeline:

- *Local pub/sub* — Subscribe `test.hello`, Publish `test.hello`,
  Unsubscribe `test.hello`, Full echo (subscribe + publish in one
  click).
- *Host triggers* — Subscribe `system.wapp.loaded` /
  `system.wapp.unloaded` / `system.error`. Open another wapp from
  the launcher after subscribing and a notification card pops out
  of the Tester wapp as the event arrives.

The Tester wapp drains its event queue in both `module_tick` (every
500 ms) and `module_handle_event` (so an `event-echo` click
produces a notification within one command round-trip). Each
received event is emitted as a `{"type":"notify",...}` message and
the host routes it through `NotificationService` → `NotificationLayer`
→ the stacking overlay. This is the simplest template for any new
wapp that wants to consume events.

**HAL subtlety — `hal_event_recv` null-terminates both buffers.**
Before writing to each destination buffer the host reserves one byte
for a `\0` terminator so that C wapps can `strlen()` the topic. The
return value is bytes written to the **data** buffer, not counting
the terminator — matching the `hal_msg_recv` convention. If you
call this from a non-C wapp that tracks lengths explicitly, just
ignore the terminator byte.

**One-way.** Wapp events do **not** get republished on the host
`EventBus` by this bridge. That direction is already covered by
`WappEventBroker.publish` firing `WappEventBridgeEvent` on every
publish — host observers can subscribe to that directly.

**Don't forget:**
- Adding a new bridged event = add a `_bridge<T>(...)` call inside
  `install()` AND a row in the table above. Schema changes to the
  JSON payload are breaking — bump the topic (e.g.
  `system.wapp.loaded.v2`) if a field needs to be renamed or
  removed.

## Notifications

### NotificationService — unified notification surface

**File:** `lib/services/notification_service.dart`

**What it is.** Singleton that every user-visible notification must
go through — from host services AND from wapps. Wraps multiple
`NotificationBackend` implementations and fans out each
`GeogramNotification` to the backends whose `handlesScope` matches.
Also subscribes to `ErrorEvent` on `EventBus` and auto-shows each
error as an error-level in-app notification.

**In-app display + backends shipped today:**
- In-app cards are drawn by `NotificationLayer` (in
  `notification_service.dart`), a **stacking overlay** installed via
  `MaterialApp.builder` (see `launcher/launcher_app.dart`) — *not* a
  `ScaffoldMessenger` snackbar. It subscribes to `NotificationShownEvent`
  on the EventBus and stacks up to 5 level-coloured cards top-right,
  auto-dismiss 3s (info/success) / 6s (error). It deliberately skips
  `scope == system` (those go only to the OS). There is **no**
  `InAppNotificationBackend` — an earlier snackbar/`rootMessengerKey`
  design was replaced by this overlay.
- `SystemTrayNotificationBackend` — handles `scope` `system`/`both`;
  delegates to `platform.showSystemNotification(...)`: `notify-send` on
  Linux (`--urgency=critical` for errors), `osascript` on macOS, and on
  Android a `MethodChannel` `com.geogram.aurora/bg_service` `notify` call
  → `BgBridge` → `NotificationManager`. Windows is not implemented yet;
  Web is a no-op.

See `docs/notifications.md` for the full developer guide.

**Wapp wire protocol** (messages the wapp sends via `hal_msg_send`):

```
{"type":"notify",
 "level":"info|success|warning|error",
 "title":"...",
 "body":"...",
 "tag":"optional dedupe key",
 "scope":"app|system|both"}
```

`wapp_page.dart`'s `_drainOutbox` translates this into
`NotificationService.instance.show(GeogramNotification(...))` with
`source="wapp:<wappName>"`. The legacy `ui.toast` message shape is
also routed through the service so old wapps inherit system-tray
delivery + history for free.

**Host-side usage:**
```dart
NotificationService.instance.show(GeogramNotification(
  level: NotificationLevel.warning,
  title: 'Low memory',
  body: 'Pausing non-critical tasks',
  source: 'host:watchdog',
  scope: NotificationScope.both,
));
```

**Scope routing.** Each backend declares which scopes it handles
(`NotificationScope.app | system | both`). The service skips
backends whose `handlesScope` returns false. Default scope is `app`.

**History.** `NotificationService` keeps a rolling in-memory list capped
at 200. Persistence is a separate `NotificationStore` (writes
`notifications/history.jsonl` in the active profile, cap 300) that drives
the bell-badge `unreadCount` and the `NotificationsPage` notification
center. See `docs/notifications.md`.

**Don't forget:**
- `NotificationService.init()` must be called exactly once, before
  `runApp`. It is wired as a `BootStart.parallel` task in
  `main.dart`; don't duplicate.
- In-app display is NOT a backend — it is handled by
  `NotificationLayer` subscribing to `NotificationShownEvent` on
  `EventBus`. The layer is installed via `MaterialApp.builder` so it
  sits above the `Navigator` and its stacking overlay renders on
  top of every route.
- Backend exceptions are **swallowed** — one broken backend cannot
  starve the others. Failures do not fire another notification to
  avoid loops.
- Never call `ScaffoldMessenger.showSnackBar` directly from wapp
  code or from services; always go through `NotificationService` so
  the behaviour stays uniform.

## Widgets

### WidgetRegistry + WidgetBroker — provider-registration system

**Files:**
- `lib/services/widget_registry.dart` — `WidgetRegistry` singleton,
  `{widgetId → [WappManifest]}`
- `lib/services/widget_broker.dart` — `WidgetBroker` singleton that
  routes `widget.request` / `widget.response` between caller and
  provider wapps

**What it is.** Android-intent-style resolution for wapp-to-wapp
widget calls. A wapp declares which widgets it can provide in its
`manifest.json` — one wapp can provide any number of widgets:

```json
"provides": {
  "widgets": ["text.greet", "text.shout"]
}
```

`LauncherPage._scanArchiveBody` rebuilds `WidgetRegistry` after
every scan. Widget IDs are free-form dot-separated strings
(`file.pick`, `image.gallery`, `text.greet`). Exact match only —
no wildcards today.

**Wire protocol — caller side (wapp → host):**

```
{"type":"widget.request",
 "widget":"<widget-id>",
 "req_id":"<opaque caller-chosen token>",
 "args":{...}}
```

**Wire protocol — host → provider (injected into provider's inbox):**

```
{"type":"widget.request",
 "widget":"<widget-id>",
 "req_id":"<opaque>",
 "reply_to":"<caller engineId>",
 "args":{...}}
```

**Wire protocol — provider → host:**

```
{"type":"widget.response",
 "req_id":"<matching caller token>",
 "result":{...}}         // on success
{"type":"widget.response",
 "req_id":"<matching caller token>",
 "error":"<message>"}     // on failure
```

**Wire protocol — host → caller (delivered to caller's inbox):**

Same shape as the provider response, plus `widget_provider: "<wapp id>"`
so the caller can tell which provider answered when preferences
change.

**Resolution rules.** When multiple wapps register for the same
widget ID, the broker picks one in this order:

1. `PreferencesService.getPreferredProvider(widgetId)` — if a
   stored preference exists AND that wapp is still installed, use
   it.
2. Otherwise, the first provider in registration order (scan order).

`PreferencesService.setPreferredProvider(widgetId, wappId)` stores
the preference; no settings UI yet (reserved for a later pass).

**Execution model — headless.** `WidgetBroker.handleRequest`
spins up a **fresh** `WappEngine` for the provider, loads the
provider's `app.wasm`, calls `module_init`, injects the request,
calls `module_handle_event`, scrapes the outbox for the matching
`widget.response`, and disposes the engine. The response is then
delivered to the caller via `WappEngine.lookup(callerEngineId)`
+ `sendMessage` + `handleEvent` — so the caller's
`module_handle_event` runs with the response in its inbox within
the same Dart microtask. Any outbox messages the caller emits in
response (e.g., a notification) drain on the caller's next tick
(≤ one tick interval of latency).

**No UI providers yet.** Providers that need to render UI (file
picker, gallery) cannot use the headless path — the WASM module
would have to emit `widget.response` without any user interaction.
A windowed-provider code path (route push + widget.response
interception) is planned for when a real UI widget lands; the
broker's `handleRequest` signature is stable so the switch will be
internal.

**Error handling.** Every failure mode in the broker produces a
`widget.response` with an `error` field so the caller always gets a
response and never hangs:

- Widget id not declared by any installed wapp
- Provider has no `app.wasm`
- Provider threw during load / init / handle_event
- Provider did not emit a matching `widget.response`

**Working end-to-end example.** The `widget_demo` wapp
(`wapps/archive/widget_demo/`) is a provider that declares both
`text.greet` and `text.shout` in a single manifest — the
canonical example of one wapp providing multiple widgets. The
**Tester** wapp's **Widgets** screen has Call buttons for each of
those widget IDs plus a "Call nonexistent widget" button that
exercises the error path. Each received response surfaces as an
in-app notification with the raw response JSON in the body.

**Don't forget:**
- Caller wapps MUST pick a unique `req_id` per request. The broker
  matches responses to requests by `req_id`. Collisions lose
  responses silently.
- The provider's `app.wasm` is re-loaded on every request. For a
  hot-path widget this is expensive — cache the engine across
  requests as a follow-up optimisation once we have a real
  workload.
- Adding a new widget id = add it to the provider's manifest +
  handle it in the provider's `module_handle_event`. Nothing else
  to register — the launcher scan picks it up on next boot.

## Tasks

### TaskMonitorService + MonitoredTask — process monitor

**Files:**
- `lib/models/monitored_task.dart` — `MonitoredTask`, `TaskStatus`,
  `TaskPriority`, `TaskType` enums, `TaskStateChangedEvent`
- `lib/services/task_monitor_service.dart` — `TaskMonitorService`
  singleton + `runMonitoredStartup` helper

**What it is.** Single registry of every background task in the
host. Solves the previous-implementation pain point of "threads
spawning everywhere with no visibility, no scheduling, no CPU
budget". Mirrors parent geogram's
`lib/services/task_monitor_service.dart` for future merge.

**Lifecycle:**
1. Owner constructs a `MonitoredTask` and calls
   `TaskMonitorService.instance.register(task)`.
2. Around each execution, owner calls `reportStart(id)`, then either
   `reportSuccess(id)` or `reportFailure(id, error)`. Wall-clock
   duration is added to `totalCpuMs` automatically.
3. Owner calls `unregister(id)` on disposal.

**Pause/resume.** `pause(id)` flips a non-critical task to
`TaskStatus.paused`; the periodic timer must check
`task.status == TaskStatus.paused` and skip its body. Critical tasks
refuse to pause. `pauseAllNonCritical()` / `resumeAll()` are the bulk
operations to hit on memory/thermal pressure.

**Wired today:**
- Every wapp's tick timer in `wapp_page.dart` registers a
  `wapp.<wappName>.<engineId>` task (`type=periodic`,
  `priority=normal`, `interval` from manifest), reports start/success/
  failure on every tick, and skips ticking when paused. Failures also
  fire `WappCrashedEvent` on `EventBus`.
- The launcher's `_scanArchive` is wrapped in `runMonitoredStartup`
  as `startup.launcher.scan` — example of the "template process
  method" pattern that every startup task should use.

**`runMonitoredStartup(id, name, init)` — the template.** Use this
helper for every one-shot startup step. It registers a
`startup.<id>` task, calls `reportStart`, runs `init`, records wall
time as `initWallMs`/`initCpuMs`, and reports success or failure.
Failures rethrow so the caller still sees them. Do **not** roll your
own try/catch around init steps — go through this helper so the
monitor sees every startup phase.

**Observing.** `TaskMonitorService.instance.tasks` returns the full
list. `stateChanges` is a `Stream<TaskStateChangedEvent>` for live UI
updates. `toJson()` produces a debug-API-friendly summary. Failures
also fire `ErrorEvent` on `EventBus`.

**Don't forget:**
- Always pair `register` with `unregister` — leaked tasks accumulate
  in the registry forever.
- `reportFailure` does **not** rethrow — the caller still has to
  decide what to do with the error.
- For `type=periodic` tasks, the `interval` field is metadata for
  the UI; the actual scheduling is done by whatever `Timer.periodic`
  the owner created. The monitor doesn't drive timers.

---

## App authoring

These components exist so the **App Creator** wapp
(`wapps/archive/app-creator/`) can let a user write, compile, and
install a new wapp without leaving geogram. They are deliberately
reusable: any future wapp that needs a syntax-highlighted editor, a
log surface, a compile pipeline, or a "write this into
`installedAppsStorage()` and rescan the launcher" step gets to drop
in the existing pieces instead of re-implementing them.

### CodeEditorField + LogViewField — GeoUI field types

**Files:**
- `lib/geoui/widgets/code_editor_field.dart`
- `lib/geoui/widgets/log_view_field.dart`
- `lib/widgets/syntax_highlight_controller.dart` (ported from the
  parent repo's `lib/widgets/syntax_highlight_controller.dart` — all
  languages the `highlighting` package supports are available,
  including `c`, `cpp`, `dart`, `javascript`)

**What they are.** Two new GeoUI field types wired into
`geoui_renderer.dart` at the `_renderFieldWidget` switch:

- `$type:"code"` → `CodeEditorField`: a monospaced `TextField` whose
  controller is a `SyntaxHighlightController`, wrapped in a dark
  container with a line-number gutter. The `language` attribute on
  the field block picks the highlight.js language id (`c`, `cpp`,
  `dart`, ...). `default` sets the initial source text.
- `$type:"log"` → `LogViewField`: a scrollable monospace list view
  backed by a `List<String>` stored in the GeoUI bindings map under
  the field name. Auto-scrolls to the bottom on each new line.

**Backed by a shared mutable list.** The list lives in the wapp
page's `_fieldValues` map under the field name. The host side
appends to it via `_drainOutbox` (`ui.log.append` handler) or
directly via the `_resolveLogBuffer(fieldName)` helper on
`_WappPageState`. The widget reads but does not mutate.

**Wapp → host protocol for log appends:**

```
{"type":"ui.log.append","field":"<field-name>","line":"..."}
```

The `field` key defaults to `output` if omitted, so most wapps can
just emit `{"type":"ui.log.append","line":"..."}` and rely on the
convention that the log group is called `output`.

**Seed defaults at load time, not at render time.** `_loadWapp`
walks every screen's block tree (`_seedFieldDefaults`) and writes
default values for every `field` descendant into `_fieldValues`
**before** the first build. `_renderCodeField` and `_renderLogField`
are therefore pure reads — they never call `widget.bindings.setValue`
from inside a `build` method (doing so would throw "setState during
build"). New field types that want defaults must either add them to
`_seedFieldDefaults` or rely on the existing string/num/bool /
`List<String>` paths.

**Don't forget:**
- `ui.log.append` lines render one per `List<String>` entry — pass
  the message pre-split, don't cram newlines in. `_logMultiline` in
  `wapp_page.dart` splits on `LineSplitter` for you if you have a
  multi-line blob.
- The log view's max height is hard-coded in
  `log_view_field.dart`. Bump it there if a log surface needs more
  screen real estate.

### WappCompilerService + CompilerBackend — the compile pipeline

**Files:** `lib/services/wapp_compiler_service.dart`

**What it is.** Thin singleton in front of a `CompilerBackend`
abstraction. A backend takes a source string + the calling wapp's
`pkg` and `workStorage`, produces a `CompileResult { ok, wasmBytes,
stdout, stderr, exitCode, durationMs, error }`. The service wraps
every call in a `MonitoredTask` (`compiler.compile`) so it appears
in the tasks wapp with wall-clock timing and success/fail counts.

**Active backend today (Phase 2a, dev-only):**
`NativeWasiSdkBackend` — shells out to `$HOME/wasi-sdk/bin/clang`
via `Process.run`. Writes the source to
`<wappData>/compile-tmp/source.c`, invokes clang with the exact
flag set the existing wapps use (`--target=wasm32-wasi -O2 -flto
-I<hal-dir> -Wl,--no-entry -Wl,--export=module_{init,tick,...}
-nostartfiles -o output.wasm source.c`), reads the output from
`<wappData>/compile-tmp/output.wasm`. The HAL header is located by
walking up from `Directory.current.path` looking for
`wapps/hal/geogram_wasm_hal.h`.

**Phase 2b todo:** add `InWasmClangBackend` that reads a bundled
wasm-clang binary from `pkg.readBytes('media/compilers/cpp.wasm')`
and runs it under a custom `WappWasiHost` (still unwritten).
`WappCompilerService.backend` becomes a runtime pick: prefer
in-wasm when the wapp package ships a compiler, fall back to native
for developers. The public API stays the same — `compile(source,
pkg, workStorage)` returns a `CompileResult` either way — so no
caller needs to change.

**Don't forget:**
- `CompileResult.failure` is the only error path — the service
  never throws. Callers check `result.ok` and surface
  `result.error` / `result.stderr`.
- The service caches nothing itself — callers are responsible for
  writing `result.wasmBytes` somewhere durable (the App Creator
  handler writes it to `<workStorage>/last_compiled.wasm`).
- `CompilerBackend.isAvailable` gates actual use; when the only
  backend is unavailable, the service returns a failure with a
  human-readable message. Don't silently fall back to a stub.

### WappInstallerService — install compiled wasm as a launcher wapp

**Files:** `lib/services/wapp_installer_service.dart`

**What it is.** Writes a new wapp directory under
`installedAppsStorage()` (`~/.local/share/geogram/apps/<folder>/`),
matching the on-disk layout the launcher's `_scanArchiveBody`
already knows how to read. Fires `WappLoadedEvent` on `EventBus`
so the launcher rescans without a restart.

**API:**

```dart
final result = await WappInstallerService.instance.installFromCompiled(
  id: 'user.geogram.my-first',
  name: 'My first wapp',
  description: 'A wapp I wrote inside geogram.',
  wasmBytes: compiledBytes,
  version: '1.0.0',          // default
  homeScreenJson: null,      // default: auto-generate a label screen
  overwrite: false,          // reject collisions unless explicit
);
```

Returns `InstallResult { ok, wappId, error }`. Collisions fail by
default — pass `overwrite: true` to replace an existing install.
Folder name is derived from the id's last dot-separated segment,
sanitised to `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`.

**Writes three files per install:**
- `manifest.json` — id, version, kind, description, tags, tick
  interval, `permissions: []` (sandboxed by default),
  `requires.hal: [log]`.
- `app.wasm` — the compiled bytes verbatim.
- `screens/home.ui.json` — caller-supplied or a default label
  screen that just says "Created with App Creator" so the wapp
  renders without errors when opened.

**Don't forget:**
- The installer does **not** validate the wasm. A broken
  `app.wasm` installs fine and fails at wapp-open time with the
  normal `WappEngine.load` error path. If that turns out to be
  painful, pre-validate by spinning up a throwaway `WappEngine` and
  calling `load`+`init` before the install (same trick the plan's
  "Run preview" follow-up will use).
- `WappLoadedEvent` is slightly overloaded — it originally fired
  when a wapp finished `module_init`, and the launcher subscribes
  to it for a different reason there. Using it for "rescan the
  launcher" works today but a dedicated `WappInstalledEvent` would
  be cleaner if we ever need to distinguish the two in the same
  handler.

### `_sendCommand` field forwarding — how actions reach compile/install

`wapp_page.dart` `_sendCommand(cmd)` now bundles a **scalar**
projection of `_fieldValues` under a `fields` key alongside the
command name:

```json
{"command":"compile","fields":{"source":"...","wapp_id":"...",...}}
```

Non-scalar entries (`List<String>` log buffers, etc.) are dropped
so log history isn't carried with every action click. Existing
wapps that only read `data['command']` ignore the extra `fields`
key harmlessly — backward-compatible.

Wapps that need the field values (App Creator is the first) parse
the nested object with the same C-side helpers `tester/main.c`
uses (`find_substr`, `extract_json_string_field`). The escaped
string values can be re-embedded verbatim into outgoing JSON
messages without un-escaping — host-side `jsonDecode` handles the
unescape on the other end. See `wapps/archive/app-creator/main.c`
for the reference implementation of a field extractor.
