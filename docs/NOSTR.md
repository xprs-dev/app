## Why

NOSTR today is a handful of big relays that everybody connects to. They give no
guarantee your notes will still be there in ten years, and where a relay *does*
promise longevity it is usually because somebody with an agenda is paying for
the disk. A protocol designed to be censorship-resistant ends up with a dozen
load-bearing servers.

The next step is the obvious one: **each user is a relay.** Each participant
hosts what it publishes, plus whatever it decided is worth keeping from other
people. If you care about an author, you keep their notes and their media on
your own devices — that is what keeps them alive. Nobody else is obliged to,
and nobody else can be leaned on to stop.

That is not a slogan, it is a storage model with consequences:

- **Your data survives because *you* carry it.** The copy in your pocket is the
  authoritative one, readable offline, on the bus, in a blackout.
- **An author survives because their readers carry them.** Popularity becomes
  literal replication. An author nobody keeps, fades — as it should.
- **No relay is load-bearing.** Any of them can be taken offline, seized, or
  quietly co-opted, and nothing is lost, because none of them was the only copy.

geogram runs NOSTR over two networks at once: the plain internet (`wss://`
relays, Blossom servers) **and** Reticulum (the mesh: LAN, BLE, LoRa, RNS hubs,
public TCP hubs). Same account, same events, same signatures. You keep
interacting with the internet NOSTR world you already use, and the same posts
land on Reticulum relays — including your own device. When the major relays of
today are gone, nothing about your account or your archive changes.

## The ecosystem: three roles

Everything below hangs off one separation, and it is the whole design:

> **Finding data, hosting data, and owning data are three different jobs, done
> by three different kinds of device, and no device is forced into more than
> the one it volunteered for.**

| Role | Answers | Stores | Typical hardware | Volunteered via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Publisher** (leaf) | "here are *my* notes" | its own posts + the authors it follows (notes **and** media) | phone, laptop — anything | nothing to volunteer; this is every user |
| **Indexer** | "*where* can I find notes from `npub…`" | **pointers only** — a who-has map. Never other people's content | old Android on a charger, home WiFi | the **Indexer wapp** |
| **Archiver** | "I *hold* a copy of that" | other people's content, up to a quota the owner sets | NAS, home server, a phone with a big card, a LoRa/BLE gateway box | the **Archiver wapp** |

A single device can be all three. Most are only a Publisher, and that is fine —
a network of pure Publishers already works, it just gets slow to search and
loses anything nobody happened to follow.

### Publisher — the floor

Every geogram device is a relay for itself. It answers queries about its own
posts, it keeps the authors it follows (that is what *follow* means here: a
storage decision, not a display filter), and it carries their media. It is
battery-powered and mostly asleep, so the network must never make it the first
thing anyone asks.

### Indexer — the phone book

If a thousand users each host their own relay, the naive design is a thousand
devices asking a thousand devices "anything new?". Phones would cook their
batteries doing nothing but answering. Fan-out is what killed every previous
attempt at this.

An **Indexer** is an ordinary device that volunteered: plugged into power, on a
home WiFi with a real uplink. An old Android in a drawer is perfectly good
hardware. It receives, from many users, statements of *what they are willing to
share*, and it answers one question:

> "Where can I find notes from `npub…`?"

**An Indexer is not a disk drive.** It gives out locations, not content. An
Indexer that vanishes costs the network a directory, not an archive — which is
exactly what stops the whole thing sliding back into "a few big servers that
have everything", the world we are leaving.

Indexers **self-nominate**, and they **sync with each other**, because
indexer-to-indexer traffic is fast and spares the small battery-powered devices.
When one goes offline you pick another that is still alive with good uptime and
ask there. No election, no registry, nothing to seize.

### Archiver — the redundancy

Pointers are worthless if every copy they point at is asleep or gone. Somebody
has to be willing to hold **other people's** bytes. That is a separate,
explicit, quota-bound offer — never an accident of having volunteered to index.

An **Archiver**:

- **Takes a quota from its owner** ("30 GB, no more") and never exceeds it.
- **Chooses what it takes**: authors it follows, topics it cares about, or
  *whatever comes over a direct link* (see below). Eviction is oldest-and-least-
  wanted first, and never touches the owner's own data.
- **Pulls from small devices.** A phone that holds the only copy of a
  neighbourhood's photos is one drop away from losing them. An Archiver mirrors
  what those devices offer to share, then **publishes itself as a provider** —
  so the DHT starts pointing at the Archiver instead of waking the phone. The
  phone's battery, and the data, both survive.
- **Store-and-forwards on direct connections.** LAN, Bluetooth and LoRa peers
  come and go and have no route to anywhere. An Archiver on those links accepts
  what they hand it, holds it, and passes it on when the other side appears — the
  bridge between an off-grid pocket of the mesh and the rest of the world. The
  machinery for this exists (`RelayCap.storeForward`, `store_forward.dart`,
  30-day TTL); the Archiver is what makes it a *role a user chooses* instead of
  a side effect of being plugged in.

An Archiver is not a backup service and makes no promise to any individual. It
is redundancy: with a handful of them around an author, that author survives the
loss of any one machine, including their own.

### How the three fit together

```
   Publisher (phone)                      Publisher (laptop)
     keeps: own posts                       keeps: own posts
            + followed authors                     + followed authors
        │  publishes ProviderRecord              │
        │  "I hold npub X"                       │
        ▼                                        ▼
   ┌──────────────────── DHT (pointer-only) ────────────────────┐
   │  key = author npub / file sha256 → [signed provider recs]  │
   └────────▲───────────────────────────────────────▲───────────┘
            │ anchored at                           │
      ┌─────┴──────┐                          ┌─────┴──────┐
      │  INDEXER   │◄──── sync ──────────────►│  INDEXER   │
      │ who-has map│  (fast, wired, spares    │ who-has map│
      │ no content │   the phones)            │ no content │
      └─────┬──────┘                          └────────────┘
            │ "npub X lives on: phone, laptop, archiver-7"
            ▼
      ┌────────────┐   mirrors small devices, publishes itself as a
      │  ARCHIVER  │   provider, so the DHT points HERE not at a phone
      │  quota-set │   ─ and store-and-forwards for LAN/BLE/LoRa peers
      └────────────┘
```

A read goes: **local store → DHT resolve (asking an Indexer first) →
connectionless probe of the returned providers → link only to one that answers
`HAVE`.** Silence costs nothing, so a sleeping phone is never charged for a query
it cannot answer. Archivers, being awake and fat, get picked over phones for the
same content — that is the point of publishing a capacity class in the record.

## What is actually built today

Verified against the code, July 2026. Paths are `reticulum-dart/lib/src/…`
unless stated.

### Roles and the directory — BUILT (Indexer only)

`services/social/relay_role.dart`:

- `enum RelayRole { leaf, indexer }` — **there is no Archiver role yet**; see the
  road below.
- `RelayCap` bit-flags: `search`, `firehose`, `storeForward`, `archive`, `probe`.
- **Role is derived from hardware, not from a setting**:
  `RelayAnnouncement.forCapacity()` — a device that is not `unlimited`
  (charger + WiFi/Ethernet) is a **leaf** advertising only `probe`. An unlimited
  device becomes an **indexer** (`search | firehose | storeForward | probe`), and
  one on the top capacity tier (pinned archive / home fibre) also goes `wide` +
  `archive`. `CapacityGovernor` re-derives it live.
- `InterestSet` — the topics and author pubkeys a node aggregates. The network
  shards **by interest**, not by hash range. `wide` = holds everything it sees.
- `RelayAnnouncement` is the advert itself: `{role, capacity, caps, wide,
  topics[], authorPrefixes[], pubkey, uptimeSeconds}`, msgpack, carried in the
  **app_data of the `geogram/relay` RNS announce** (≤ ~350 B, one announce).
  Authors are advertised as **4-byte prefixes** — enough to shard, not enough to
  be a mailing list.
- `RelayDirectory` — every relay announce heard is observed with its hop count
  (TTL 1 h). `indexers()`, `identityForPubkey(npub) → RnsIdentity`, and
  **`bestIndexer({topic, author})`**, scored: explicit interest match +1000,
  wide/archive +400, capacity `(9-cap)*20`, `−hops*10`, freshness as tiebreak.

So "find another indexer with good uptime and ask there" already works: uptime
is announced, the directory is live, selection is one call.

### Asking a peer without waking it — BUILT

`RelayNode.answerProbe` (`services/social/relay_node.dart`) is a
**connectionless NOSTR probe**: the query rides a datagram, and a peer holding
nothing **answers with silence** — no link, no Curve25519 handshake, no radio
burn. If the answer fits a datagram it comes back inline; if not the peer says
`HAVE n` and the querier opens a link. Advertised as `RelayCap.probe`, so older
nodes keep getting links exactly as before.

### The who-has layer — BUILT (for files and folders)

`services/files/dht/` — Kademlia over RNS links. The property that makes it the
right substrate for Indexers:

> **Holders store pointers only.** The only value in the DHT is a signed
> `ProviderRecord` = *"pubkey X provides sha256 Y, capacity class C, expires in
> 45 min"* (~176 B, Ed25519-signed by the provider, so a relaying node cannot
> forge one). No content, ever.

- Key = first 16 bytes of a sha256 (`dhtFileKey`), or an arbitrary 32-byte key —
  **folders already publish under their NOSTR public key**
  (`FileTransferNode.publishKey` / `resolveProviders`). Publishing under an
  *author's* npub is therefore possible with the code as it stands.
- `DhtNode`: `k`, `alpha`, iterative FIND_NODE/FIND_VALUE, STORE with anti-abuse
  caps (`maxStoredKeys`, `maxRecordsPerKey`, `storesRejected`), dead-holder
  pruning (`demoteProvider` after a failed fetch), lazy TTL expiry, liveness
  eviction after 5 failed RPCs.
- **Persistence anchors**: `DhtNode(anchors:)` is a set of always-on nodes that
  every STORE also goes to and every resolve asks *first*, regardless of XOR
  distance. The app feeds it **the relay indexers** (`rns_service.dart`
  `stableAnchors:` = `_relayDir.indexers()` filtered to the good capacity
  classes, capped to 6). That join — *Indexers are the DHT's anchors* — is the
  load-bearing piece of the whole design, and it is live.
- Records republish every 30 min against a 45-min TTL, so a provider that goes
  away leaves the directory by itself.

### Store-and-forward — BUILT (as a side effect, not as a role)

`services/social/store_forward.dart`: a message for an offline recipient is
deposited at a node advertising `RelayCap.storeForward` (found via the
directory) and flushed when the recipient's LXMF destination announces. 30-day
TTL. This is the Archiver's job, already implemented — it just has no owner-facing
role, no quota UI, and no direct-link (LAN/BLE/LoRa) policy yet.

### The device as a relay — BUILT

- **Over Reticulum**: `RelayNode` answers `REQ` / `COUNT` / `EVENT` / `DEPOSIT`
  / `DROP` over RNS links (`relay_protocol.dart`), backed by `RelayEventStore`
  (SQLite + FTS5, NIP-50 search). A **leaf still answers queries about its own
  posts** — "ask the author directly" is a real path.
- **Over the LAN**: `NostrWsServer` — any stock NOSTR client on the LAN can use
  this device as a `wss://` relay, NIP-11 and all.
- **Media**: `blossom_server.dart` serves content-addressed blobs over HTTP, and
  the same blobs are fetchable over Reticulum by sha256 through
  `FileTransferNode` + `MediaFileSource`, with a Blossom-style **deposit** opcode
  (`file_transfer.dart`, BIP-340-authorised) for asking a host to keep a blob —
  the primitive an Archiver accepts on. Blossom-over-Reticulum as an
  HTTP-compatible service does **not** exist; the RNS path is the files layer.

### Retention: what a node keeps — BUILT

`retention_tier.dart` + `host_retention_policy.dart`: every event is tiered
**self (0) / followed (1) / stranger (2)**. Strangers get a byte slice, a
notes-per-month cap and a retention window; eviction only ever deletes tier 2,
never kinds 0/3. Anything *about you* — a reply, a repost, a reaction carrying
your `p` tag — is stored at tier 0 the moment it arrives, which is why your
notifications and the notes they point at are readable with the radio off.

**This is "you keep what matters to you", implemented.** It is also the skeleton
of the Archiver quota: `HostQuota{ceilingBytes, strangerSliceBytes,
strangerNotesPerMonth, strangerRetentionMs}` already exists and is enforced.

### Two networks, one store — BUILT

The client (`nostr_relay_hub.dart`) is transport-abstract: a relay is a URI.
`wss://` → the internet, `local` → this device's own store, `rns://<idhash>` → a
relay on the mesh. Every event from every transport is signature-verified and
merged into **one** store, so the feed is a single unified cache and a post goes
out over both. The user-facing panel is **NOSTR on Internet** (relays + Blossom
servers: add / remove / enable-disable).

### Reading the public internet: the ingest pipeline — BUILT

This is the half of the system the user actually looks at, and it was the least
written-down. Everything below is `nostr_relay_hub.dart` +
`nostr_ws_client.dart`, running inside the **`nostr-engine` isolate** (Schnorr
never touches the UI thread — see `docs/performance.md`).

**The relay list is a merge, not a seed.** `kDefaultNostrRelays` is offered to a
device *on every start*, not only when the list is empty — but only for relays it
has **never been offered before** (`offered`, persisted beside the list). So a
relay added to the defaults later reaches an install that already exists, and a
relay the user **removed or disabled stays gone**. Seeding on first run only is
how a device gets stranded: a phone was found holding two relays, one unreachable
from its network and one that serves no firehose, with a sixteen-hour-old feed and
no way for a newer default to ever reach it.

**Five kinds of subscription, and they are not equal.**

| Sub | Filter | Feeds |
|---|---|---|
| `fireR*` — the **firehose** | `kinds:[0,1] limit:200` | the **All** tab. Live push, sub-second |
| `discoR*` / `discoF*` — **discovery** | `kinds:[7]`, then fetch the liked ids | "popular" — can only ever surface a post that *already* has likes |
| `myfollows` | `authors:[…]` | the **Following** tab |
| `prof*` / `fireP*` | `kinds:[0]` | names and avatars; batched on a slow timer |
| `stat*` | reactions/replies for on-screen posts | like and reply counts |
| notifications | `kinds:[1,6,7] #p:me` | the bell — pinned at tier 0 (see the touch rule) |

Discovery is **not** the All tab and never was: a post cannot have likes the
moment it is published, so a like-gated feed guarantees the newest thing on
screen is an hour old. All = firehose + the quality gate.

**Order of operations in `_onEvent` is load-bearing.** In order:

1. **Anything `p`-tagging me is stored first**, at tier 0 — before the reaction
   short-circuit and **before the rate cap**. A reaction to my post is a fact
   about me and the relay that carried it may be gone tomorrow.
2. Reaction receipts for **tracked** posts (the ones on screen) are persisted.
   The kind-7 firehose is thousands a minute; persisting all of it would be one
   unbatched INSERT per stranger's like, forever.
3. Engagement tallies, then discovery tally — both *consume* reactions.
4. **The firehose branch, and only then the rate cap.** The quality gate
   (`feed_quality.dart`) decides what is stored and shown; the cap protects the
   *generic* path, which stores everything it is handed. Getting this backwards
   is fatal and did happen: relays answer a fresh subscription with a burst (200
   events each, times every relay), the cap is 15 per 250 ms, so the burst was
   discarded **before the gate saw a single post** — `dropped=173, fireSeen=0,
   stored=0` with four relays streaming happily.

> **Invariant for anything added here: a rate limiter must never sit in front of
> the quality gate.** The gate is the thing that knows what deserves to exist.

**Failure is silent by default, so it must be made loud.** Three ways a relay
stops feeding you *without raising an error anywhere*:

- **It refuses a subscription** — NIP-01 `CLOSED` (rate-limited, too many
  filters, auth-required). Parsed and thrown away for a long time; now logged and
  raised to the hub (`onClosed`).
- **The socket half-opens** — connected, no data, no error (the phone changed
  network; a carrier NAT dropped the flow). A client holding open subscriptions
  is never legitimately silent for minutes: **90 s of silence = the socket is
  dead**, reconnect (subscriptions are replayed on connect).
- **It quietly drops one subscription** while still carrying the others. Then the
  socket looks healthy, the REQ is on the wire, and nothing arrives. Re-sending
  the REQ down that same connection is useless — the relay already decided to
  ignore it. Two silent watchdog rounds ⇒ **cycle the socket**, don't re-ask.

> **Invariant: silence is a diagnosis, not a state.** Any new transport must be
> able to say *why* nothing is arriving — "connected" is not evidence of health.

**Duplicates: three different bugs wearing one face.** They are worth separating,
because the fixes do not overlap:

1. **The same event on several subscriptions.** One note published to several
   relays comes back on the firehose *and* discovery *and* follows, each with its
   own seen-set, and the wapp pours all three into one feed. Fix: **the event id
   is the post's identity** — the host refuses an append whose id is already in
   that field (`wapp_page.dart`), and the archive enforces it with a partial
   UNIQUE index on `mid`.
2. **A relay re-sending its recent window.** Every re-open replays events. The
   per-subscription seen-set must be **evicted (oldest first), never cleared** —
   clearing it made re-sent events look new.
3. **The same words posted again as a genuinely new event.** Different id,
   different timestamp, correct signature. Id-dedup cannot see these. Collapse on
   the **pair — same author AND same text** — newest kept, display-level only.
   *Text alone is not a duplicate rule*: two people both saying "OK" are two
   people. And when the same paragraph arrives from **different pubkeys** (a
   name-and-avatar impersonation cluster), it is not a duplicate at all — it is
   spam, and it belongs to the gate and the mute list, not to dedup.

**What the gate keeps is observable**: `perf: nostr firehose seen=… kept=… pending=…
expired=… empty=… flooding=… linkOnly=… duplicate=…`. A filter nobody can see is a
filter nobody can trust, and "the feed looks empty" has two completely different
causes — the gate ate it, or the relay sent nothing — with completely different
fixes.

## The bridge: bring your account, keep what you touch

**The common case is not a fresh start.** Somebody arrives with a NOSTR account
they already have, following people who are perfectly happy on Damus and Primal
and have never heard of Reticulum. Nothing about that should change. geogram is
an ordinary NOSTR client to them: it reads the internet relays, it posts to the
internet relays, the conversation carries on exactly as before.

What changes is what happens *behind* that, and it costs the user nothing to
notice: **while you are connected to both networks — and most of the time you
are — every interaction quietly becomes a copy that survives the internet.**

### The rule: to touch it is to keep it

A like is not a fleeting gesture. It is a *statement that this thing mattered*,
and it is the cheapest, truest signal we will ever get about what is worth
preserving. So we take it literally:

> **When you interact with an event, that event — not just your reaction to it —
> is archived on your own relay, at tier 0, forever, and served from there to
> Reticulum.**

| You do this | What is kept |
|---|---|
| **Like / react** (kind 7) | your reaction **and the note you reacted to**, its author's profile (kind 0), and its media |
| **Reply** (kind 1 with an `e` tag) | your reply, the note you replied to, and **the thread above it** (parents up to the root — a reply with no context is worthless in ten years) |
| **Repost / quote** (kind 6 / 1 with a `q`) | the reposted note and its author's profile. You put your name on it; you keep it |
| **Bookmark / save** | the note, its media, its author. This is the *explicit* form of the same act |
| **Zap** | same as a like — you paid for it, you certainly meant it |
| **Follow** (kind 3) | already true today: tier 1, their notes are kept as they arrive |

Everything else you merely scrolled past stays a stranger (tier 2), lives under
quota, and is evicted in time. **The archive grows along the shape of your
attention** — which is the only ranking function nobody can buy.

### Media comes too, while it still can

A liked note whose photo lives on a Blossom server is half a memory. So the same
act pulls the referenced blobs into the local `MediaArchive` (content-addressed by
sha256, already built), from the internet, **now, while the internet is there** —
the whole point being that later, it is not. That is a real cost, so it is a real
setting: notes always; media by size cap, on WiFi, or never (Settings, and the
Archiver wapp for the machines with disks). But the default for something you
*liked* is: **take the picture too.**

### And then it is on Reticulum

Once it is in your store it is on the mesh, because your store *is* your relay
(`RelayNode` serves it, `local` in the relay list is the same events). Nothing
else has to happen for a peer over LoRa to be able to fetch a note that was
published on Damus this morning and liked by you at lunch.

Two further steps make it *findable* rather than merely present:

- **Publish the pointer.** A `ProviderRecord` under the author's npub and under
  the event id — *"I hold this"* — so an Indexer can answer "where can I find that
  note" with your device. (Road item 1.)
- **Push, don't just hold.** Events you author, and events you kept, are offered
  to the Reticulum Indexers and Archivers you know, so the copy is not a single
  point of failure sitting in your pocket.

### When you write a note

Publishing is one action with two destinations, and they carry different things
on purpose:

1. **To the public internet relays — the note itself.** Exactly as any other
   NOSTR client: signed, `EVENT`, to every enabled `wss://` relay. Your friends
   on Damus see it immediately; nothing about your existing social life changes.
2. **To your own store — the note itself, tier 0.** It is yours. It is now
   served over Reticulum by your own `RelayNode`, and it is readable on your
   device with every radio off.
3. **To the Reticulum Indexers — *information about* the note, not the note.**
   An Indexer is a phone book, and a new post is a phone-book update: a signed
   `ProviderRecord` saying *"npub X has new material; the copy lives here"*,
   under the author key and the event id. Bytes stay with the author. That is
   what keeps an Indexer from silently turning back into a server, and it is why
   this scales to a thousand publishers on a hilltop LoRa link — a pointer is
   ~176 bytes whatever the size of the note.

**Archivers may then pull the content** — that is their role, and the pointer is
how they find out there is something to pull. So the copy stops being a single
point of failure sitting in your pocket, without any Indexer ever having been
asked to hold it.

The mesh side is a **queue, not a blocking step**. If Reticulum is unreachable
right now (or the internet is), the outbound sits in an outbox and drains when a
path appears. Publishing never waits on the worse of the two networks — and
because an event id is a content hash, delivering it twice is free. Which is the
next point.

### The same signature on both sides — why the merge is trivially safe

This only works because NOSTR made the right choice: **an event id is the sha256
of its content, and the signature is over that id.** So:

- The *same* event fetched from Damus and from a LoRa gateway is byte-identical
  and has the same id. Merging is just a `put` — dedup is by id, and the store
  already does it.
- There is no "internet version" and "mesh version" of anything. No forks, no
  reconciliation, no sync conflicts. One key, one signature, two pipes.
- A post you make goes out to `wss://` relays **and** to `local` **and** to the
  mesh in one operation, with one signature. Your friends on Damus see it; a
  neighbour with no internet sees the same bytes.

### The transition is a fade, not a flag day

Nobody has to be told "the internet relays are gone now, switch". As the public
relays get worse — dropping old events, going paid, disappearing, being leaned
on — what you kept is already here, already served, already findable over
Reticulum, and your reading and posting continue against a relay list that simply
has fewer `wss://` entries in it than it used to. **The migration happened years
ago, one like at a time.**

An honest limit, said out loud: this preserves **what your community touched**,
not "all of NOSTR". Nobody is archiving the firehose, and pretending otherwise
would be the lie that sinks the whole idea. A note nobody ever liked, replied to,
reposted or followed the author of will not survive the death of the relay it
sat on — and that is the correct outcome, because storage is finite and attention
is the only honest way to spend it.

### Where this stands in the code

**The whole path, end to end, is built and device-validated.** A note fetched
from a public relay and touched by the user ends up served from this device over
Reticulum, and the round trip has been demonstrated on a phone:

1. **Fetched** from `wss://` over the firehose/follows subscription, verified in
   the `nostr-engine` isolate, merged into the one `RelayEventStore` (tier 2 —
   a stranger, evictable).
2. **Touched** (like / reply / repost / bookmark / zap). `KeepPolicy` +
   `KeepService` **promote the target itself to tier 0** — not just your
   reaction — chase the thread above a reply, ask for the author's kind-0, and
   pull the referenced media into the content-addressed `MediaArchive`. A keep
   can only ever *promote*, so a hostile re-send cannot push a kept note back
   into the evictable slice. The queue is **persisted**, so a like made in a
   tunnel is finished later by the background service.
3. **Kept locally** at tier 0, which means it is **already on Reticulum**: your
   store *is* your relay. `RelayNode` answers `REQ`/`COUNT` over RNS out of the
   same store, and `local` in the relay list is the same events. The device's own
   `wss://` server (`NostrWsServer`) serves it to LAN clients too. **Proof: a
   note first seen on a public relay was afterwards served back out of the
   phone's own `wss://` relay.**
4. **Findable**, not merely present: touching or following an author publishes a
   signed `ProviderRecord` under their pubkey and under the event id — *"I hold
   this"* — so an Indexer answers *where*, and `fetchAuthorFromMesh` walks the
   reverse path (resolve → ask the best holders over RNS → verify in the engine
   isolate → store).

Still **not built** on this path: the outbox that lets a publish survive one of
the two networks being down (a publish to `wss://` while offline is queued in the
ws client, but the mesh half is not), and pushing kept events to Indexers and
Archivers rather than waiting to be asked.

## Abuse: what a hostile network does to us, and what stops it

Everything above is a promise to hold other people's data. That is an open door,
and it *will* be walked through. The attacks are not hypothetical — they are the
cheapest things to do to any system like this:

| Attack | What it looks like |
|---|---|
| **Sybil flood** | ten thousand generated npubs, each publishing junk, each publishing pointers claiming to hold it |
| **Eviction attack** | fill an Archiver with bogus notes and blobs until the quota rolls over and **the real, old data is thrown out** — the payload is not the junk, it is the deletion |
| **Blossom stuffing** | upload garbage blobs, or deposit them, until the disk is gone |
| **Pointer poison** | publish `ProviderRecord`s for content you do not have, so every resolve wastes a fetch on you |
| **Amplification** | make a phone serve 4 GB to strangers over cellular, on someone else's dime |

### The first rule: a stranger can never evict

This is the one that matters, and it is a **structural** answer, not a heuristic
one. The store is already tiered — self (0), followed (1), stranger (2) — and
`pruneHosted()` **only ever deletes tier 2**. Make that a hard partition with its
own byte budget:

> **Stranger data can only ever evict stranger data.** No amount of junk, from
> any number of npubs, can push out a note you liked, an author you follow, or a
> photo you kept. The junk competes with *itself* for a slice of disk you chose
> the size of, and everything that matters lives outside that slice.

An eviction attack then achieves nothing except deleting other junk. It is not
mitigated, it is *pointless* — and that is the difference between a defence and
a race.

### Cost, identity and reference: three gates on the way in

**1. Nothing anonymous gets stored for free.** Admission is scored, not binary,
and the ladder is: *me → people I follow → people they follow (WoT, already
computed for the feed) → a stranger who paid → everyone else.* The first three
are effectively unlimited (they are the point of the machine). A stranger gets
the stranger slice, per-pubkey caps within it, and a per-month note count — all
of which `HostQuota` already enforces; what is missing is that a *new* npub with
no history and no path to us in the web of trust starts at the bottom of the
ladder, not in the middle.

**2. A stranger who wants more than the slice pays.** Not money — *cost*. A
proof-of-work stamp on the event, or the participation coin's postage
(`coin/postage_gate.dart`, built and unwired). Ten thousand npubs are free to
generate; ten thousand PoW stamps are not, and that is the entire asymmetry we
need. The cost applies to **storage and to serving**, not to reading — nobody
pays to be listened to.

**3. A blob must be spoken for.** This is the Blossom answer, and it is simple:
**no orphan blobs.** A blob is admitted only if some event *already in our store,
at a tier we care about*, references its sha256. You cannot fill an Archiver with
pictures by uploading pictures — you would first have to get a note referencing
them accepted, which puts you back at gate 1. Uploads from unknown accounts are
off by default (they already are); the deposit opcode is BIP-340-authorised
(already is); and a deposit is now also *checked against the reference rule*
before a byte is written.

### Pointers cannot lie for long

A `ProviderRecord` is signed by the provider, so nobody can forge one *for*
somebody else, and the DHT already caps `maxRecordsPerKey` and `maxStoredKeys`
and counts `storesRejected`. What remains is a provider that lies about *itself*
— claims to hold a file, then does not serve it. `demoteProvider()` already
exists: a fetch that fails drops the record locally. Make it social: an Indexer
that hears a demotion for a provider it vouched for **lowers that provider's
standing in its own answers**, and a provider whose records are demoted repeatedly
stops being handed out. Lying costs you the only thing you have — being chosen.

### Serving: a budget for strangers, and none for friends

Point (4) of the brief, and it is its own section below: **Bandwidth belongs to
the owner of the device.** See *Serving quota* further down.

### What is honest to say

None of this makes abuse impossible. It makes it **expensive, self-limiting, and
incapable of destroying anything you chose to keep** — which is the achievable
goal. A system that promised more would be lying.

## Reticulum first, the internet second

**Default search order: local store → Reticulum → the public internet.** Not for
performance — for exposure.

Fetching a file over the internet tells a server, and everyone on the path to it,
**your IP address and exactly what you are reading**. Blossom is content-addressed
HTTPS: the sha256 you request *is* the identity of the content, and the request
carries your address on it. A Reticulum fetch carries neither — destinations are
cryptographic hashes, the path is a mesh, and the device that answers you knows a
destination, not a person at an address.

So:

- **Files and media: always try Reticulum first**, even when it is slower. A slow
  private fetch beats a fast one that publishes your reading list. The internet
  is the fallback, not the default, and if the blob is available from a peer it is
  never fetched over HTTP at all.
- **Notes: local, then the mesh, then the relays.** Same order, same reason. A
  `REQ` to a public relay tells that relay who you follow, what you search for and
  when you are awake; a query answered from the store or a mesh peer tells it
  nothing.
- **Search terms leave the device last of all.** A NIP-50 search against a public
  relay is a search *log entry* on somebody else's disk. Search the local FTS5
  index and the mesh Indexers first; go to the internet only when the user asked
  for something we plainly do not have, and prefer relays the user chose.
- **The user is told which path served them.** A small badge — *served over
  Reticulum* / *fetched from the internet* — because a privacy property nobody can
  observe is a privacy property nobody should believe. (The transport tag already
  exists in the chat wapp; the same idea, one layer up.)

The cost is honest: sometimes the mesh does not have it, and the fallback is a
real fetch with a real IP. That is a *timeout and a fallback*, not a silent
preference for whatever answers first — and the user can turn the fallback off
entirely on a device that must never touch the internet.

## What an Indexer actually answers

An Indexer never says "here is the file". It says **"these N devices have it"** —
and the redundancy is the *point*, not an accident. But a bare list of npubs is
almost useless: the client still has to guess which one to call, and guessing
wrong costs a wasted link, a wasted transmission, or a stranger's cellular data.

So the answer to a resolve carries, **per holder**, what a caller needs to choose
well:

| Per holder | Why the client needs it |
|---|---|
| **Provider pubkey + destination** | who to call |
| **Last heard** (seconds ago) | a holder last seen 3 weeks ago is a lottery ticket; one seen 40 seconds ago is a phone call |
| **Provenance of that fact** | *"I heard this myself"* vs *"Indexer B told me, and B had heard it 20 minutes before that"*. After sync, freshness is **second-hand**, and the age of the *information* is not the age of the *device*. Both are reported: `heard 5m ago (direct)` vs `heard 30m ago (via B, synced 5m ago)` |
| **Power + uplink** (from the physical profile) | this is the whole reason the profile exists: **prefer the box on mains and WiFi over the phone on battery and a metered data plan.** Same file, very different cost to the person holding it |
| **Capacity class** | already in the `ProviderRecord` today |
| **Radios + listening schedule** | if the only path to a holder is LoRa, the caller needs the frequency and the window before it tries |
| **Coverage region** | is this holder even in a position to reach me when the internet is down |

The client then picks by a rule the user would recognise as fair: **an awake
machine on mains and WiFi first; a battery phone on cellular last, and only if
nothing else has it.** A holder on a metered connection is a *last resort*, and
the network should feel that way to the person carrying it — the reward for
volunteering a good machine is that it, and not somebody's phone, is the one that
gets called.

Wire-wise this is a few extra bytes per holder in the `VALUE` reply (last-heard as
a varint, a provenance byte, and the announce's capacity/power/uplink nibbles the
Indexer already holds in its directory). It costs nothing to carry and it removes
the guesswork entirely.

## Serving quota: bandwidth belongs to the device's owner

Holding data for others is generous. Being made to *pay* to hand it out is not —
and the two are different taps. A hostile client cannot delete your data (the
tier partition sees to that), but it can absolutely make your phone push
gigabytes to strangers over a data plan you are paying for. That is the
amplification attack, and the answer is a budget with the requester's identity in
it.

**Trusted requesters are unmetered. Strangers get a budget.**

- **Me, my other devices, the people I follow, and (optionally) their follows** —
  no restriction. The whole purpose of keeping their data is to hand it back to
  them.
- **Everyone else** — a bandwidth quota the owner sets, in the units a human
  actually thinks in: *"up to 500 MB a day to people I don't know"*, and
  separately *"…and nothing at all when I'm on cellular"*. `ServeQuota` already
  has a daily byte budget and a `servingAllowed` flag driven by the capacity
  governor; what it lacks is **who is asking**, which the link already tells us
  (every relay/file link is authenticated by the peer's key).
- **Per-stranger caps under the aggregate**, so one npub cannot eat the whole
  stranger budget and starve the rest.
- **Graceful refusal, not silence.** Over budget, a node does not go dark — it
  answers *"not me, try one of these"* and hands back the other providers from the
  DHT. The request still gets served, by the machine that volunteered for it. A
  hostile client, meanwhile, learns nothing and gets nothing.
- **The defaults are the important part.** A phone on cellular serves strangers
  **nothing**, by default, today (`serveOnCellular`). That stays. An Archiver on
  mains and fibre serves generously, by default — because it *volunteered*, and
  that is what the role means.

The Archiver wapp's **Quota** screen owns the storage half of this; the same panel
gains the bandwidth half, because to a user they are one question with two
numbers: *how much of my disk, and how much of my line?*

## Status: what is built, and what is not

Updated as the road lands. Nothing here is aspirational — if it says BUILT, it
is in `main` with tests, and the device-validated ones say so.

### Landed since this document was written

- **The touch rule** (`keep_policy.dart`, `keep_service.dart`) — BUILT, and
  **validated on a phone against live internet relays**: an upvote pins the note
  itself at tier 0 in the store this device serves, chases the thread above a
  reply, asks for the author's kind-0, and pulls the pictures. A keep can only
  ever *promote*, so a hostile re-send cannot push a kept note back into the
  evictable slice. The queue is persisted, so a like made in a tunnel is
  finished by the background service. **Proof: a note first seen on a public
  relay was afterwards served back out of the phone's own `wss://` relay.**
- **Author-provider records** — BUILT. Following, keeping, or touching an author
  publishes a signed `ProviderRecord` under their 32-byte pubkey, so "where can I
  find npub X" is a DHT resolve whose answer is a list of devices. The reverse
  path (`fetchAuthorFromMesh`) resolves, asks the best providers over Reticulum,
  verifies in the engine isolate, and stores.
- **The hard tier partition** — BUILT (it was already structural; it is now
  *asserted*). A flood of twenty stranger npubs evicts only stranger junk: never
  my posts, never a followed person's words, never a photo I kept. An eviction
  attack is not mitigated, it is pointless.
- **Identity-aware serving** — BUILT. `ServeQuota` knows who is asking: my own
  devices and the people I follow are unmetered; strangers share one daily
  budget the owner sets, zero on cellular.
- **Reticulum-first media** — BUILT. A Blossom URL carries its sha256, so the
  mesh is tried first and the internet is a fallback that can be switched off
  entirely; the log names the path that served the bytes.
- **The physical profile + the resilience score** — BUILT (`node_profile.dart`,
  `listening_schedule.dart`), announced in the relay app_data, editable in
  **Settings → Hardware**, and device-validated. Facts only on the wire — there
  is no "I am precious" field, and a test asserts it. `bestIndexer()` picks the
  fibre box on a normal day and, from the *same* directory and the *same*
  announces, the solar+Starlink+LoRa box when the internet path is gone.
- **The listening schedule** — BUILT. `always` · `every 30m for 3m` ·
  `06:00-18:00 weekdays` · `dawn-dusk` · `dawn+30m-dusk-30m`. Clock-free duty
  terms are normative (an ESP32 after a reboot can honour them from `millis()`
  alone), a node with no clock may advertise nothing else, and a duty cycle tells
  a caller to retry across one full period rather than give up after one
  unanswered call.
- **Verification off the UI isolate** — BUILT. Events arriving over Reticulum are
  verified in the `nostr-engine` isolate and stored with `putAllVerified`; main
  never runs secp256k1.
- **Feed health against the public internet** — BUILT and device-validated (a
  phone whose All/Following had not moved in sixteen hours, on a network hostile
  to relays). Four defects, each hiding the next, and each one is now an
  invariant with a test:
  - **Relay defaults merge on every start** (never-offered only), so an existing
    install is not stranded on a dead list and a removed relay is not
    resurrected.
  - **The quality gate runs before the rate cap.** The cap was discarding the
    relays' opening burst before the gate saw it: `dropped=173, fireSeen=0,
    stored=0` with four relays streaming. A burst larger than the cap must still
    reach the feed.
  - **A refused subscription (`CLOSED`) and a half-open socket are reported**,
    and a relay that stops answering gets a **new socket, not another REQ**.
  - **Duplicates are three separate problems** — same event on several subs (id
    dedup), a relay re-sending its window (evict the seen-set, never clear it),
    and one account re-posting the same words (collapse on author+text, newest
    kept). Same text from *different* pubkeys is spam, not a duplicate: that is
    the gate's and the mute list's job, and content-only dedup is forbidden — two
    people saying "OK" are two people.

### Not built (do not assume it)

1. **Indexers still answer *what*, not *where*.** An Indexer is still a relay
   host that stores stranger events under quota and serves them back. The
   pointer-only model is the target; the DHT implements the primitive and author
   records now feed it, but the Indexer's *answer* is not yet the pointer map.
2. ~~Indexer↔Indexer sync~~ — **BUILT end to end**: pointer log, `(epoch, seq)`
   cursor (persisted, so an ESP32 resumes after a reboot),
   `SYNC_REQ`/`SYNC_RES`/`SYNC_RESET` served by `RelayNode`, a merge that verifies
   every record against the provider that signed it, and a scheduler that runs
   only when this device IS an Indexer and only talks to peers that say they are
   too — battery leaves are never sync partners. **VALIDATED ACROSS TWO INTERNET
   CONNECTIONS**: two phones on different networks, one published a pointer (a
   like → keep → author record) and the other pulled it — `sync: 3b02bb89 +2 -0
   bad=0 seq=2`, after a correct SYNC_RESET on first contact. Superseded text:
   `PointerLog` (append-only, insertions *and* removals, bounded + compacted),
   the `(epoch, seq)` cursor a clockless node can persist, `PointerSyncServer` /
   `PointerSyncClient` (verify every record against the provider that signed it —
   a forged envelope and a rebuilt log are both covered by tests), and
   `SYNC_REQ`/`SYNC_RES`/`SYNC_RESET` on the relay protocol. What is missing is
   the *scheduler*: nothing yet picks sync partners from the directory and runs
   the exchange on a timer.
3. ~~The Archiver~~ — **BUILT and device-validated.** `ArchiverPolicy` +
   `admitToArchive` (silence is not consent; a quota is a ceiling; a direct-link
   peer gets in on the strength of the link; everything else must be something
   the owner volunteered for), enforced on every deposit. The **direct-link
   admission now fires**: the main isolate already ingests every packet with its
   arrival interface, so it remembers it per link and a LAN/Bluetooth/LoRa peer
   is recognised as one with no route to anywhere else. An unknown interface
   reads as the internet — the safe default, asserted by test. The
   **mirror-the-small-devices loop** runs: an Archiver pulls what the leaves
   around it share, then publishes itself, so the DHT hands out the mains box
   instead of somebody's phone. And the **Archiver wapp** ships: opens at 0 GB,
   raises in 5 GB steps, and lists everything held for others with a drop on
   every row.
4. ~~Resolve answers are bare.~~ **BUILT.** The `VALUE` reply now carries a
   6-byte `HolderHint` per record: last-heard, whether that is first-hand or came
   from a sync (a rumour is discounted), and the holder's power, uplink and
   radios — filled in by the host from the relay directory. `scoreHolder` puts the
   mains-and-WiFi box first and the battery phone on cellular last. Hints ride
   *after* the records, so a node that predates them is none the wiser.
5. **`rns://` relay URIs are inert in the shipped app.** The relay hub runs on a
   background isolate constructed with `rnsClientFactory: null`, so an `rns://…`
   entry resolves to a null client. Real Reticulum relay traffic goes through
   `RelayNode` on the main isolate instead. `NostrRnsClient` is complete and
   unused.
6. **No long-lived subscriptions over RNS.** A `REQ` returns one `RESULT` and
   ends; mesh "subscriptions" poll. Correct for a mesh — just don't expect push.
7. **The remaining abuse gates.** The WoT-scored admission ladder, the
   postage/PoW cost for the stranger tail (`coin/postage_gate.dart` exists and is
   unwired), the **no-orphan-blobs** rule on deposits and uploads, and demotion
   feeding back into an Indexer's ranking.
8. **No Blossom over Reticulum** (HTTP only), and BUD-02 upload auth is not
   verified — uploads are gated by a toggle.
9. ~~The Indexer and Archiver wapps~~ — **BUILT and device-validated.** The
   Indexer is a statistics-first dashboard on a new native `$type:"stats"` GeoUI
   widget (stat tiles + a 48-hour requests-per-hour sparkline backed by a
   persisted hourly ring), with the volunteer control, editable indexing topics
   (persisted, re-announced with a typing debounce), and previewed maintenance
   sweeps whose removals propagate through the pointer log. **No per-entity
   lists anywhere** — pointers, authors and peers could be millions, so the UI
   shows counts and shapes, never rows. The Archiver owns the quota, the policy
   and the statistics/cleanup Space screen. HAL families `hal.node` and
   `hal.archive`.
10. **Search is not yet privacy-ordered.** Media and single notes are (the mesh
    is resolved and asked first, and a kept note now has a pointer of its own so
    it can be found by id). A NIP-50 *search* still goes to the relays before the
    mesh Indexers are asked.

## Planned: the physical profile — what a node is made of

Every role above is a promise about *software*. Whether a node can keep that
promise on the worst day of the year is a question about **hardware, power and
antennas**, and today the code asks only two-thirds of one of those questions
(`CapacityProfile`: is it charging, and what kind of network — that's it).

That is not enough. **A solar-powered Indexer on Starlink is worth more than a
hundred fibre boxes when the grid goes down**, and the network has to be able to
know that *before* it needs it. So every node — Publisher, Indexer, Archiver —
carries a physical profile, and every node that has to choose a peer can read it.

### What is announced

Added to `RelayAnnouncement` (the `geogram/relay` announce app_data, msgpack,
short keys, ~20–30 B on top of the existing ~350 B budget — it must never cost a
second announce packet):

| Field | Key | Values |
|---|---|---|
| **Power source** | `ps` | `grid` · `grid+ups` · `solar` · `solar+battery` · `wind/hydro` · `vehicle` · `battery-only` |
| **Powered fraction** | `pw` | 0–100: **percent of the last 7 days this node actually had power**. Measured by the governor, not typed by the user |
| **Uplink kind** | `up` | `fibre/wired` · `wifi` · `cellular` · `satellite` (Starlink et al.) · `none` — *offgrid*, mesh-only |
| **Uplink speed** | `bw` | measured bytes/sec, log-bucketed (one byte: 2^n) — an *observed* number, not a sales figure |
| **Other links** | `lk` | bitmask: `LoRa` · `Bluetooth` · `WiFi-Direct` · `packet radio / AX.25` · `serial` · `RNS TCP hub` |
| **Autonomy** | `au` | hours this node expects to keep running with no grid and no sun (battery bank ÷ draw). 0 = unknown |
| **Coverage** | `gh` + `rx[]` | a **coarse** geohash of the region this node serves, plus **one entry per radio**: its range, its band, and the frequency it is listening on (see below). Absent = says nothing about where it is |

Two rules keep this honest:

1. **Announce facts, score locally.** A node never announces "I am precious".
   It announces what it *is*; every asker computes its own score from that. There
   is nothing to inflate that would be believed, because…
2. **Claims are corroborated by observation.** A node claiming `pw: 100` that we
   have heard from twice in a week is scored on the two times we heard it. The
   `RelayDirectory` already tracks observed uptime, freshness and hop count, and
   `bw` is checked against what the transfer actually did. **Observed beats
   claimed, always.** Self-reported physical facts are a *hint that saves a
   measurement*, never a credential.

`pw`, `bw` and `au` are measured by the existing `CapacityGovernor` (extended: it
already samples charging state and network kind on a timer — it starts keeping a
7-day powered-fraction ring and a throughput estimate). `ps`, `up` and `lk` are
the parts a human must state — nothing on Android can tell you the roof has a
solar panel on it, and no API reports a LoRa antenna.

### Coverage: where a node is useful, and how far it reaches

A radio has a footprint, and that footprint is the whole point of it. "There is a
LoRa gateway with a 12 km range on the hill above the valley" is *actionable* —
it tells a phone in that valley who to shout at, and it tells the network which
nodes still connect two towns when everything between them is down. A LoRa node
that never says where it is is a radio nobody can find.

So the profile can carry:

- **`gh`** — a **geohash of the region the node serves**. Deliberately coarse.
- **`rx[]`** — **one entry per radio this node listens on**, because one number
  cannot describe a machine with two antennas.

#### One range per link, because the antennas are not the same

A node may have Bluetooth (tens of metres), a LoRa gateway (a few km), and an HF
or VHF station that reaches 80 km. Collapsing that into a single "range" is a
lie in both directions: it makes the Bluetooth look magical and the radio look
useless. Each radio therefore gets its own entry:

| Sub-field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `l` | which link — LoRa · packet radio / AX.25 · Bluetooth · WiFi-Direct · other |
| `r` | **range in km** for *this* link, as the person who raised the antenna estimates it |
| `f` | **the frequency it is listening on**, in kHz (868 200, 433 775, 144 800, 14 105 …). 0 = not applicable (Bluetooth) |
| `m` | modulation / mode, short string: `LoRa-SF7BW125`, `FSK`, `AX.25-1200`, `JS8`, … — free-form, because the radio world will always invent another one |
| `d` | **when it is listening** — a schedule string (next section). Default `always` |

**The frequency is the point.** A range says a station *could* hear you; a
frequency says *where to call*. Without it, discovering "there is an 80 km packet
station over that ridge" is a fact you cannot act on — you would have to guess
the band, and guessing is exactly what a mesh is supposed to spare you. With it,
a phone with a LoRa dongle, or an operator with an HF rig, knows precisely what
to tune to and in which mode.

Wire cost: 4–5 chars of geohash, plus ~8–14 bytes per radio entry. Two radios is
about 30 bytes — inside the announce budget, and if a node really has five, the
list is capped and the longest-range ones win, because those are the ones nobody
else can substitute.

#### The listening schedule (`d`)

Solar and battery stations do not hear 24/7 — they wake, listen and sleep. **A
node that is only reachable in a window is not broken, it is thrifty**, and a
caller who gives up after one unanswered call has thrown away a perfectly good
station. So the schedule is part of the advert, and it is **one string that a
person can read and a machine can parse** — no separate "display" and "wire"
forms to drift apart, and nothing a user has to translate into cron.

**Grammar** (case-insensitive, canonical form is lower-case):

```
schedule   := "always" | term ("," term)*        ; commas = union ("or")
term       := duty | window
duty       := "every" span "for" span            ; clock-free — a repeating cycle
window     := range [ days ]                     ; needs a clock
range      := point "-" point
point      := HH:MM | "dawn" | "dusk" [ offset ]
offset     := ("+"|"-") span
days       := "mon".."sun" ( "," day | "-" day )* | "weekdays" | "weekends" | "daily"
span       := INT ("m"|"h")                      ; minutes or hours
```

Times are **UTC** unless suffixed `local` — a mesh spans time zones, and a
station that says `06:00-18:00` and means "my local morning" is a station nobody
can call. `dawn`/`dusk` resolve against the node's own announced coverage region
(that is the second thing the geohash is for): a solar node's real schedule *is*
the sun, and writing it as `dawn-dusk` stays correct in December.

**Examples — this is the whole feature:**

| String | Reads as | Who says it |
|---|---|---|
| `always` | listening 24/7 | mains-powered gateway |
| `every 30m for 3m` | wakes for 3 minutes, every 30 | battery LoRa node |
| `every 10m for 1m` | 1 minute in every 10 | ESP32 with no clock |
| `06:00-18:00` | daylight hours, UTC, every day | solar node, fixed window |
| `06:00-18:00 local` | the same, in its own time zone | a person's home station |
| `dawn-dusk` | as long as the sun is up, wherever it is | solar node, done right |
| `dawn+30m-dusk-30m` | sun up, with a margin to charge | cautious solar node |
| `08:00-20:00 weekdays, 10:00-14:00 sat` | an office box and its Saturday | a club station |
| `every 15m for 2m, 18:00-22:00` | thrifty all day, wide open in the evening | the common real case |

**Clockless is not a degraded mode, it is a first mode.** `every N for M` needs
no calendar, no NTP, no RTC — it is a duty cycle, and an ESP32 that just rebooted
can honour it from `millis()` alone. Anything the node cannot resolve, it must
not claim: **a node with no clock advertises only `duty` terms.** Advertising
`06:00-18:00` when you cannot tell the time is a lie that costs a caller a wasted
transmission on a battery, which is exactly the resource this whole design exists
to protect.

**What the caller does with it.** Parse → *is it listening now?* → if yes, call.
If no, `nextWindow()` gives the instant it wakes, and the call is queued for then
rather than burned now. With a duty cycle and no shared clock, phase is unknown —
so the caller **retries across one full period** (`every 30m for 3m` ⇒ keep trying
for 30 minutes, and you are guaranteed to land inside a listening window) instead
of concluding the station is dead after one try. A schedule that turns out to be
wrong is corrected by observation, like every other claim: the directory already
records when a peer actually answered.

**On the wire** the string is short enough (`every 30m for 3m` is 17 bytes) that
it can simply be sent as text, and the announce budget can take it for one or two
radios. A node that is tight for space may send the **canonical packed form**
instead — one byte of kind, then the parameters (`duty`: two varints; `window`:
two 11-bit minute-of-day values, a day bitmask, and a flag for UTC/local/solar) —
typically 3–5 bytes. **The text is normative and the packed form is an
optimisation**: they must round-trip, and a receiver that does not understand a
term ignores that term rather than the whole schedule (so a future `dawn` term
never breaks an old node — it just makes it call at a time the station is asleep,
which is the failure it already knows how to survive).

The parser, the packer and `isListeningNow()` / `nextWindow()` are one small
pure-Dart file with a table-driven test, testable with no radio in the room.

Rules, and they are firm because this is the one field that can hurt somebody:

- **It is a region, never a position.** The user does not report GPS — they
  **pick a place on the map** (reuse the existing `maps` wapp / the host's map
  picker) and choose how coarse to be. The stored value is a truncated geohash;
  the precision *is* the privacy control, and it is shown as what it means:
  *5 characters ≈ a town (±2.4 km)*, *4 ≈ a district (±20 km)*, *3 ≈ a region
  (±78 km)*. Default for a phone: **nothing at all**.
- **Opt-in, per device, and it defaults to off.** A phone in someone's pocket has
  no business advertising where it sleeps. This field exists for **infrastructure
  that wants to be found**: the gateway on the hill, the solar box on the roof of
  the community centre, the Archiver in the village hall. Those nodes gain
  everything by being locatable and risk nothing — they are already a physical
  antenna in a public place.
- **Coarse by construction.** A truncated geohash cannot be sharpened, and each
  range is one number in km. There is nothing here to triangulate with. If a user
  picks town-level precision, town-level is all that exists on the wire — the
  fine bits are never stored, so they cannot leak later. (A licensed station is a
  separate case: its callsign and its location are already public by law, and its
  operator may well *want* the precise entry. That is their choice to make, not
  our default.)
- **It is a claim like any other.** A node saying "80 km on 144.800" is telling
  you what to *try*, not what is true. Whether it answers is the only real
  evidence, and the directory already keeps that.

What it buys, all of it at the moment the internet is not there:

- **"Who can reach me right now, and on what?"** — a phone with no signal filters
  the directory to nodes whose region is adjacent to its own and whose radios
  plausibly cover the gap, then calls them **on the link and the frequency they
  said they were listening on** — instead of spraying the whole mesh. A node with
  a LoRa dongle only cares about the LoRa entries; an operator with a VHF rig only
  cares about the packet ones. Same announce, different reader.
- **A map of the mesh that a human can read.** The Reticulum wapp already draws a
  graph; with coverage it can draw it *on the map*: who covers this valley, where
  the hole is, which single node is bridging two towns (and therefore which one
  to add redundancy next to). That is a picture a community can act on.
- **Disaster routing.** When the score enters degraded mode (below), coverage is
  how a node decides *which* solar-and-LoRa neighbour is worth waking: the one
  whose footprint actually overlaps the people who need it.

### The score, and why it changes with the weather

Every asker computes a **resilience score** locally, from the announced facts and
its own observations. Two profiles, and the node switches between them by itself:

**Normal times** — the internet is up, and what matters is speed and closeness:
uplink speed, low hop count, high uptime. A fibre box wins. This is roughly what
`bestIndexer()` scores today (interest match, capacity class, hops, freshness).

**Degraded mode** — entered when the internet path is *gone*: no `wss://` relay
reachable, no RNS TCP hub answering, for long enough that it is not a blip. Now
the weights invert, and the scoring becomes a survivability question:

| Signal | Why it is worth points when things are broken |
|---|---|
| **Grid-independent power** (`solar+battery`, `wind/hydro`, high `au`) | It is still running. Nothing else matters if it is dark. |
| **Grid-independent uplink** (`satellite`) | Starlink survives the local ISP, the local exchange and the local flood. It is a path *out* that does not depend on any infrastructure between here and the horizon. |
| **Off-grid links** (`LoRa`, `packet radio`, `Bluetooth`) | It can be *reached* without any internet at all — from a phone with no signal, over kilometres, on a battery. |
| **Coverage that overlaps mine, on a radio I actually have** (`gh` + `rx[]`) | A solar LoRa gateway 200 km away cannot help me. The one on the hill above this valley can — and if all I own is LoRa, its 80 km HF entry is worth nothing to me while its 6 km LoRa entry is worth everything. Score per link, not per node. |
| **High powered-fraction, observed** | It was there yesterday, and the day before. |
| Uplink speed | Still counts, but far below all of the above. A slow node that exists beats a fast node that is a brick. |

So **solar + Starlink + LoRa** is the top of the table in a disaster and
unremarkable on a Tuesday — which is exactly right, and exactly what a fixed
score cannot express. A node with that profile should also be *told* it is
precious, and asked (in the wapp) to keep itself that way: pinned interests, a
bigger quota, sync partners chosen for reach rather than speed.

Nothing here is a new transport or a new protocol — it is six fields in an
announce, a governor that already runs, and a scoring function that reads the
room. That is deliberate: **the disaster case must not depend on code that only
runs during a disaster.** The same announce, the same directory, the same probe;
only the weights move.

### Where it shows up

- **`bestIndexer()` / provider selection** — the score replaces the current
  capacity-class-only ordering, and the DHT's `ProviderRecord` capacity class
  gains the same treatment (prefer an Archiver that is still powered over one
  that is not).
- **DHT anchors** — the persistence anchors an Indexer publishes to should skew
  toward grid-independent nodes, because an anchor set that all shares one grid
  is not an anchor set.
- **Sync partners** — an Indexer in degraded mode syncs with whoever is *still
  there*, not with whoever is fastest.
- **Settings → Hardware** (below) — stated once, for the device, and read by
  every role.

### Stated once: Settings → Hardware

The physical profile describes **the device**, not a role. A user who volunteers
the same box as an Indexer *and* an Archiver must not be asked twice what it is
plugged into, and two answers that can disagree is a bug waiting to be filed.

So it lives in **Settings, as its own full-size panel** — not a section squeezed
into a list, because the point is to make the *combinations* easy to state:
power source × uplink kind × which radios are actually attached. A full panel can
lay those out as pickers and toggles that read like a description of the machine
in front of you; a settings row cannot.

The panel holds:

- **What only a human knows** — power source (grid / grid+UPS / solar /
  solar+battery / wind / vehicle / battery-only), uplink kind (wired / WiFi /
  cellular / satellite / none), autonomy in hours without grid or sun, and which
  extra links are physically attached (LoRa, Bluetooth, WiFi-Direct, packet
  radio, serial). Sensible defaults, so a normal phone user never touches it.
- **Coverage** (off by default) — *"pick the area this device serves"* opens the
  **map**; the user drops a pin and chooses the precision with a slider labelled
  in plain words (town / district / region). The panel draws the resulting circle:
  **this is what the network will be told, and nothing finer.** A phone leaves it
  off; the gateway on the hill turns it on, because being found is the entire
  reason it is up there.
- **Radios** — a row per antenna, added by the user, because a machine with a
  LoRa hat *and* a VHF rig has two very different footprints and one number would
  lie about both. Each row: the link, the **range in km**, the **frequency it
  listens on**, the mode, and **when it is listening**. Each row draws its own
  circle on the same map, in its own colour, so the user *sees* the difference
  between 6 km of LoRa and 80 km of packet — and so does the network.
- **The schedule editor** is a picker, not a text box, but it *writes the string*
  and shows it: pick `always`, or `every [30m] for [3m]`, or `[06:00]–[18:00]` on
  chosen days, or `dawn–dusk`, and the panel prints back the canonical line
  (`every 30m for 3m, 18:00-22:00`) plus a plain-language sentence and a 24-hour
  strip showing the awake bands. Typing the string by hand is allowed and parses
  to the same thing — the string is the format, the picker is a convenience.
  A device with no clock is offered **only** the `every N for M` form, because it
  cannot honestly promise a time of day.
- **What the device measured for them** — powered fraction over the last 7 days,
  real observed throughput. Read-only, and shown next to the claims so the two
  can be compared honestly.
- **What it means** — the resilience score in **both** modes, in plain words:
  *"On a normal day this device is an ordinary node. If the grid goes down it
  becomes one of the most valuable ones your network has."* People who own such
  hardware should be told, because they are the ones who decide whether to keep
  it running.

Roles **read** this profile; they never restate it. The Indexer and Archiver
wapps each show a one-line summary of it with a link straight into the panel
(*"Solar · Starlink · LoRa · 96% powered — change in Settings"*), and everything
else — the announce, the score, anchor choice, sync-partner choice — is derived
from the single stored profile. One source of truth, one place to edit it.

## Planned: Indexer↔Indexer sync — "what changed?"

Indexers exchange **addresses, never content**: the unit of sync is the signed
`ProviderRecord` (*"pubkey X provides key K, capacity C, expires at T"*, ~176 B),
which is exactly what the DHT already stores. Because every record is signed by
the provider itself, an Indexer can pass on a record it received from a third
party and the receiver still verifies it end-to-end — a relaying Indexer cannot
forge, retarget or resurrect a pointer. That is what makes gossip between them
safe, and what lets a fresh Indexer fill its map from a peer instead of by
waiting for a thousand phones to re-announce.

Indexer-to-indexer traffic is fast and wired, so this is where the load should
sit: the phones announce once, the Indexers spread it among themselves.

### The pointer log

Each Indexer keeps its pointer map as an **append-only log**, and every entry
gets, at the moment it is accepted:

- **`seq`** — a strictly increasing 64-bit counter, local to this Indexer, that
  never repeats and never goes backwards. It is a *position in my log*, not a
  measure of anything.
- **`ts`** — the local wall-clock time, **when the node has a clock**. Optional.
- **`epoch`** — a random 8-byte id for the *current* log. Regenerated whenever
  the log is truncated, rebuilt, wiped, or restored from a snapshot.

The log holds insertions *and* removals (a provider that was demoted, a record
that expired), because "this address is dead" is as important to propagate as
"this address is new" — otherwise every Indexer's map only ever grows.

### Two cursors, because not every node has a clock

A peer asks **"what changed since …"** and may express *since* in either of two
ways. Both are answered; a node offers whichever it can honour.

| Cursor | Asked by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **`since_seq` + `epoch`** | anything, and the **only** option for a clockless node | "resume my read of *your* log at position `seq`" |
| **`since_ts`** | a node with a working clock | "everything you accepted after this instant" |

The sequence cursor is the primitive and the time cursor is the convenience.
**An ESP32 that reboots has no idea what day it is** — it has no RTC, no NTP, and
possibly no route to anything that does. It cannot say "since Tuesday". But it
*can* persist eight bytes: the last `(epoch, seq)` it read from each peer it
syncs with. That is a durable, restart-proof, clock-free cursor, and it is why
`seq` — not time — is the normative one. A time cursor is also inherently
untrustworthy across a fleet: two Indexers with skewed clocks will silently drop
or duplicate records at the boundary. `seq` cannot skew, because it is not a
measurement — it is a position in one node's log, interpreted only by that node.

**`epoch` is what makes `seq` safe.** A cursor is only meaningful against the log
it came from. If the peer's `epoch` no longer matches the one the cursor carries,
the peer's log was rebuilt underneath us and the position is meaningless — the
peer says so, and the asker restarts from zero (or from a snapshot, below)
instead of silently missing everything that happened in between. This is the
failure mode that quietly corrupts every naive "sync since N" design, and the
epoch closes it for the price of eight bytes.

### The exchange

Three new opcodes on the existing relay protocol (msgpack over an RNS link,
alongside `EVENT`/`REQ`/`COUNT`/`DEPOSIT`/`DROP` — see `relay_protocol.dart`):

| op | payload | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SYNC_REQ` | `[op, epoch?, since_seq?, since_ts?, filter?, max]` | "what changed since…" — `filter` narrows to an interest set (topics / author prefixes), so a small Indexer syncs only its own shard |
| `SYNC_RES` | `[op, epoch, records[], removals[], next_seq, more]` | a bounded batch, plus the cursor to resume from and whether there is more waiting |
| `SYNC_RESET` | `[op, epoch, oldest_seq]` | "your cursor is not from this log (or is older than what I still hold) — start over" |

Rules that make it survive real networks:

- **Bounded batches, resumable.** `max` caps the batch to what fits a link; the
  asker loops on `next_seq` while `more` is set. A LoRa-attached Indexer takes
  the same log in tiny bites over hours; the cursor makes that free.
- **Idempotent merge.** A record is keyed by `(key, providerPub)` and the newest
  `timestampMs` wins. Replaying an overlapping range is harmless, so a cursor
  that is *too old* costs bandwidth, never correctness. Nodes should always
  re-ask from slightly before their cursor rather than risk a gap.
- **Verify on arrival, always.** Every record's signature is checked against
  `providerPub` before it enters the map; unsigned or expired records are
  dropped, not relayed. An Indexer never has to trust the Indexer it is talking
  to.
- **Removals are TTL-bounded too.** A removal (`demoteProvider`, expiry) is kept
  in the log long enough to propagate, then compacted away — otherwise the log is
  immortal. Compaction bumps `oldest_seq`, and any peer whose cursor predates
  that gets a `SYNC_RESET`.
- **Snapshot for the cold or the reset.** A node with no cursor (or a rejected
  one) asks for a filtered snapshot of the *live* map — expired records already
  gone — and receives it as a normal batched stream ending at the peer's current
  `next_seq`. A fresh Indexer is useful within one exchange instead of after a
  full announce cycle.
- **Anti-abuse is the same as everywhere else.** The store caps
  (`maxStoredKeys`, `maxRecordsPerKey`) apply to synced records exactly as to
  direct STOREs, so a hostile peer cannot inflate a neighbour's map, and a
  provider that never answers a fetch is pruned locally (`demoteProvider`)
  regardless of who vouched for it.

### Who syncs with whom

From the `RelayDirectory`: peers advertising `RelayCap.search`, preferring high
uptime and low hop count (both already announced), a handful at a time, at an
interval scaled to capacity — a home-fibre Indexer every few minutes, a LoRa one
when the link is idle. **Battery-powered leaves are never sync partners**: they
announce, they are indexed, they are left alone. That asymmetry is the whole
reason the role exists.

## Planned: the Indexer wapp

**Purpose: let a person volunteer a device, see what it is doing for the network,
and take the offer back.** Today the role is inferred from the charger and the
WiFi, which is right as a *default* but wrong as the *only* way — a user with an
old phone in a drawer has no way to say "yes, use this", and a user on a metered
home line has no way to say "no, don't".

Screens:

- **Volunteer** — one switch: *Serve as an Indexer*. States: `off` /
  `on when plugged in` (the current behaviour) / `always on`. Shows plainly what
  it costs (uplink, no meaningful disk) and what it does **not** do: *an Indexer
  stores no one else's posts. It remembers where they are. It is not a backup.*
- **What I answer** — the interest set (`InterestSet`): topics and authors this
  node indexes, or **wide** (index everything it hears). Prefilled from what the
  owner already follows.
- **Live** — the numbers, because a role nobody can inspect is a role nobody
  trusts: queries answered/hour, pointers held, distinct authors covered,
  providers demoted (dead pointers pruned), uptime as announced, peers who chose
  us as their anchor.
- **The network** — the `RelayDirectory` as a list: the other Indexers this
  device knows, their capacity, uptime and hop distance, which one is currently
  `bestIndexer` for a given author.
- **Sync** — one row per peer we sync pointers with: its `epoch`, our cursor
  (`seq`, and the time if it has a clock), how far behind we are, records pulled
  and pushed, and when a `SYNC_RESET` last forced a restart. A stuck cursor is
  the first thing to look at when an Indexer starts giving stale answers, so it
  has to be visible.

Host work behind it: expose the role manager (`RelayRoleManager.applyCapacity` +
an explicit override), the `InterestSet`, and the `DhtNode` counters
(`storedKeys`, `replicasStored`, `providersDemoted`, `storesRejected`) through
the HAL. Wire the road items 1–4 below so the numbers are about *pointers*, not
about stored notes.

## Planned: the Archiver wapp

**Purpose: let a person donate storage on purpose, with a number they choose,
and know exactly what is on their disk and why.**

Screens:

- **Quota** — a slider and a number: *hold up to N GB for other people*. This is
  the whole contract. Current use, free space, what gets evicted next
  (oldest-and-least-wanted; the owner's own data is never touched). Backed by
  `HostQuota`, which already enforces a ceiling, a stranger slice, a monthly
  note cap and a retention window.
- **What I host** — checkboxes, and they are the interesting part:
  - *Authors I follow* — the default; redundancy for the people this user
    already cares about.
  - *Topics* — the interest set again.
  - *Whatever arrives over a direct link* — **LAN, Bluetooth, LoRa**. A peer
    with no route to anywhere hands its data to this device, which holds it and
    passes it on when the far side appears. This is store-and-forward as an
    explicit, quota-bound *offer* rather than a side effect of being plugged in.
    Per-transport switches, because a LoRa gateway wants a very different policy
    (tiny, precious, slow) from a LAN box.
  - *Mirror the small devices near me* — pull what battery-powered peers are
    willing to share, then publish ourselves as a provider so the DHT stops
    waking them.
- **What's on my disk** — a real list: author, size, how many other providers
  hold this (redundancy count, from the DHT), last time somebody actually fetched
  it. With **Drop** on every row. A user who cannot see and delete what strangers
  put on their machine has not consented to anything.
- **Deposits** — inbound "please keep this blob" requests (the BIP-340-authorised
  deposit opcode already exists): accept / reject policy, and a log.
The physical profile is **not** repeated here — it is the device's, stated once in
Settings → Hardware. The wapp shows the one-line summary and links into it. It
matters more to an Archiver than to anyone, though: an Archiver that dies with the
grid is holding the only copy of somebody's photos on a disk that just went dark,
and a solar Archiver with a LoRa antenna is where a neighbourhood's data should
live — so the summary line is what the quota screen should be read against.

Host work behind it: a `RelayRole.archiver` (or a capability flag on the
announce, which is cheaper on the wire — `RelayCap.archive` already exists and
is currently derived, not chosen), the quota + policy plumbed to `HostQuota` and
the deposit verdict hook, per-transport admission (the interface a peer arrived
on is already known), and the mirror loop generalised from the existing
indexer-host folder mirroring (`_autoSyncTick`).

## The road

Dependency order. Each step is small and independently useful.

0. ~~**The touch rule + the bridge**~~ — **DONE** (device-validated): a `KeepPolicy` between the wapp's
   like/reply/repost/bookmark and `store.put(tier:)`, so interacting with an
   internet note pins **the note**, its author's profile, its thread parents and
   its media — locally, at tier 0. Plus the publish path notifying the Reticulum
   Indexers, and an outbox so a publish survives either network being down. This
   is first because it is what makes everything below have something to point at.
1. ~~**Publish author-provider records.**~~ — **DONE**. When a device keeps an author (follow ⇒
   tier 1 ⇒ it already stores their notes) or keeps a note by the touch rule,
   publish a `ProviderRecord` under `key = the author's 32-byte pubkey` (and the
   event id), exactly as folders already do. "Who has notes from `npub…`" becomes
   a DHT resolve, and the answer is a list of devices — not a server.
2. **Resolve-then-probe-then-ask in the client.** Local store → DHT resolve
   (anchored at Indexers) → connectionless probe of the providers → link only to
   one that says `HAVE`. Silence costs nothing; this is what keeps a
   thousand-relay network from melting phones.
3. **Make the Indexer pointer-only.** It answers *where* and stores the provider
   map, not the notes. It may keep a small hot cache of recent events for its
   advertised interests (that is what `RelayCap.firehose` means), but its promise
   to the network is the directory. Told to the user in those words: *an Indexer
   is not your backup.*
4. ~~**Indexer↔Indexer sync**~~ — **BUILT** (log, cursor, protocol, verified
   merge; 15 tests). Remaining: the scheduler that picks partners from the
   directory and runs it on a timer.
5. ~~**The physical profile**~~ — **DONE** (announce + Settings → Hardware, device-validated): power, uplink and autonomy on the announce,
   plus an opt-in coverage region (coarse, picked on the map) with **one entry per
   radio** — its range, its listening frequency, its mode and its duty. The
   governor extended to measure powered-fraction and throughput. **One full-size
   Hardware panel in Settings**, where the device is described once and each radio
   draws its own circle on the map. And a resilience score that re-weights itself
   when the internet path disappears, scoring **per link** — a neighbour's 80 km
   HF entry is worthless to a caller who only owns LoRa. Do this *before* the
   wapps, so both read a profile that already exists instead of each growing its
   own copy of it.
6. **The Indexer wapp** (above) — the role becomes something a person grants,
   inspects and revokes.
7. **The Archiver role**, then the **Archiver wapp** (above): quota, policy,
   direct-link store-and-forward, mirror-the-small-devices, and a visible,
   deletable list of what is being held for others.
8. **Retention rules on both.** What is worth a pointer: a record signed by a
   provider that actually answers, an author somebody follows, a topic in the
   interest set. What is not: unsolicited floods (the store caps), records whose
   provider never answers a fetch (`demoteProvider` already prunes those), and
   eventually a postage/PoW cost per store for the abusive tail.
8a. **The abuse defences** — the **hard tier partition is DONE and asserted**; the rest (WoT ladder, postage, no-orphan-blobs, demotion feedback) remains. It
    is the one that makes an eviction attack pointless rather than merely
    expensive, and it is a few lines in `pruneHosted()` plus a separate byte
    budget. Then the WoT admission ladder, the no-orphan-blobs rule on deposits
    and uploads, the postage gate for the tail, and demotion feeding back into
    Indexer ranking.
8b. ~~**Identity-aware serving**~~ — **DONE**: the peer key is already on the link, so
    `ServeQuota` learns *who* — unmetered for me/my devices/my follows, a
    stranger budget the owner sets in MB/day, per-stranger caps under it, nothing
    at all on cellular by default, and a graceful *"not me, try these"* refusal
    that hands back the other providers instead of going dark.
8c. **Rich resolve answers** (above): last-heard + provenance (direct vs synced,
    and how old the *information* is), power/uplink, radios and schedule per
    holder, so the client calls the mains-powered box and leaves the phone on
    cellular alone.
8d. **Reticulum first, internet second** — **DONE for media** (the log names the path; the badge and the notes/search half remain), end to end, with a visible badge
    saying which path served the user and a switch to turn the internet fallback
    off entirely.
9. **Media follows the author.** Following keeps their blobs too — Blossom is
   part of the package. Your phone carries the photos and videos of the people
   you care about, fetchable over the internet by sha256 *or* over Reticulum from
   another device that also kept them. Archivers hold the redundant copies.
10. **Merge the two worlds properly.** Wire `rnsClientFactory` so `rns://` relays
   are first-class in the same relay list as `wss://` ones, and a single post
   fans out to internet relays, mesh Indexers, Archivers and the copy on your own
   disk, in one operation, with one signature. That is the end state: NOSTR works
   exactly as it does today, and it keeps working after the relays we use today
   are gone.

## How Nomadnet propagation should work (the intended picture)

The Social "Nomadnet" feed carries NOSTR publications over Reticulum. The
mechanism has three moving parts — **discovery**, **content fan-out**, and
**pointer sync + content-pull** — and they must not be conflated. Announces are
flooded by the hubs and arrive reliably; point-to-point *links* between two
hub-connected clients are what actually carry event content, and they are the
fragile part. The pictures below are how it is meant to hang together.

### 0. Two devices, both charger+WiFi → both Indexers

```
        C61 (X1A67X)                              TANK2 (X1RD89)
     charger + WiFi = INDEXER                 charger + WiFi = INDEXER
     serve=true (answers whole store)         serve=true (answers whole store)
        │                                        │
        └──────────── public RNS hubs ───────────┘
              (rns.beleth / inertia / wisco …)
        announces FLOOD through here reliably;
        client↔client LINKS must be established through here (the fragile bit)
```

A phone plugged in but sitting at 100% reports `NOT_CHARGING`
(`connectedNotCharging`) — that still counts as **on power**, so it is an
Indexer, not a Publisher-only leaf.

### 1. Discovery — role rides the announce that survives

The dedicated `geogram/relay` announce is dropped by the hubs' announce
rate-limiting. So the RelayAnnouncement (role, services, capacity, pubkey,
optional coords) is **piggybacked onto the callsign/chat announce** — the one
that always gets through:

```
  C61 announce  ─▶  app_data = "X1A67X" 0x00 <RelayAnnouncement: indexer,
                                                caps=search|firehose|…, npub, hw>
                         │  flooded by hubs
                         ▼
  TANK2 receiver: split on NUL
        ├─ "X1A67X"           → callsign → _callIdentity (reachable peer)
        └─ <RelayAnnouncement> → _relayDir.observe → "heard indexer 3b02bb89"
```

Result: each phone lists the other as a searchable Indexer → the precondition
for both fan-out and pointer sync.

### 2. Content fan-out — the fast path when a link exists

On publish, the note (and any kind-6/7 reaction) is stored locally and PUSHED as
a signed EVENT to every announced Indexer. The receiver's `onEvent` refreshes the
open feed instantly — no poll:

```
  C61: user posts "hello"
     │ relayPublish
     ├─▶ local store (self tier)                    [visible on C61 instantly]
     └─▶ _relay.publish(TANK2, EVENT "hello") ─────▶ TANK2 store.put
                                                        │ onEvent (z=rns)
                                                        ▼
                                                 onNomadnetInbound
                                                        ▼
                                          TANK2 Nomadnet refreshes NOW
```

Requires a working C61→TANK2 link. When that link forms, this is the sub-second
path.

### 3. Pointer sync + content-pull — the catch-up / no-shared-indexer path

Pointer sync trades **who-has**, never bytes. So after sync learns a location,
the content must be pulled in a second step over the same (already-warm) link:

```
  C61                                         TANK2
  publishAuthorProvider(self)
    → pointer log: {key=npub_C61, provider=C61}
        │  SYNC_REQ / SYNC_RES (epoch,seq)
        └──────────────────────────────────▶  acceptSyncedPointer
                                                 "C61 holds notes from npub_C61"
                                                        │ _pullAuthorNotesFrom(C61, npub_C61)
                                                        ▼
                              REQ kind[1,6,7] authors=[npub_C61] z=rns since=cursor
        answer: the actual notes  ◀───────────────────┤
                                                        ▼
                                       verify → store → onNomadnetInbound
                                                        ▼
                                          TANK2 Nomadnet shows them
```

Same link requirement — the content-pull REQ has to be answered.

### 4. The incremental pull — the steady-state backstop

While the Nomadnet tab is open, each Indexer/peer is asked **only for what is new
since our last contact with IT** (a persisted per-target cursor), so bandwidth is
spent on new content and a newly-met Indexer still gets its backlog:

```
  every 90s while viewing Nomadnet:
    for each target T in {best indexer, heard relays, callsign peers}:
        since = cursor[T] ?? now-6h
        REQ kind[1,6,7] z=rns since  ─▶ T
        answer ─▶ verify → archive; cursor[T] = newest_created_at + 1
```

### The dependency, stated plainly

```

                       ▼

        └──────────────┬───────────────┘
                       ▼
        ***a point-to-point RNS link that ANSWERS***   ← the current wall:
                       │                                   REQ/sync return
                       ▼                                   "0 answered" between
             note bytes cross → feed shows it             two NAT'd phones
```

Everything above the wall is built and, through discovery, verified. The wall is
the transport: two hub-connected clients hearing each other's announces but not
yet forming an answered link for content. Nothing in the NOSTR or sync layers
fixes that — it is path-request / link-establishment through the hubs.

## What actually works — validated cross-device findings

The "current wall" above was written when links between two NAT'd phones returned
`0 answered` and nothing crossed. That wall has since been **cleared in
practice**: with the transport routed over the chat destination (see below),
publications, replies, reply-to-replies, and likes all propagate between two
phones **on different internet networks, through public hubs only, with no static
paths**. This section records what was proven on real devices (C61 `X1A67X` ↔
TANK2 `X1RD89`) and *why* it works, so the mechanics are not mistaken for luck.

### Finding 1 — the link answers once it rides the chat destination

The relay REQ/EVENT/SYNC links were dialing the peer's `geogram/relay`
destination, which the hubs rate-limit and **drop** — so there was never a path
and the link timed out (`0 answered`). The fix that made everything cross: route
relay links over the **chat destination** (the announce that always propagates),
exactly as the DHT already does, and demux the two RPC protocols sharing that
destination with a 1-byte frame tag (`DHT=0x01`, `relay=0x02`). After this, REQ
and EVENT frames are answered and content moves. **This is the single change that
turned "nothing crosses" into "everything crosses."**

### Finding 2 — delivery does NOT require a direct A↔B link; a shared Indexer is enough

The two phones rarely form a *direct* answered link (asymmetric NAT — see
Finding 3). They don't need one. Delivery converges through a **mutually-reachable
Indexer**:

```
  C61 posts/likes ──fan-out push──▶  Indexer 95432b8d  ◀──incremental pull── TANK2
      (author fans to its                (both phones                (weak leg pulls
       announced indexers)                heard this hash)             from the shared one)
```

The operational signature to look for: the SAME `relay: heard indexer <hash>`
line on BOTH devices. Once a common hash appears, the weakly-connected phone pulls
the content from it even though it can't reach the author directly. In the live
run the shared hash was `95432b8d`; C61 had fanned the reply+like there, TANK2
pulled it from there. **A shared Indexer is the reliable path; a direct link is
the fast bonus when it happens.**

### Finding 3 — reachability is asymmetric, and that is normal

The two legs are not symmetric. C61 reported `1 geogram device · 4 hubs · 8 other
peers`; TANK2 reported `On the network … 1 hub`, no direct geograms. The
better-connected node reaches the other directly and its own posts push straight
across; the weak node cannot pull from the author and must go through the shared
Indexer. Consequence for testing: **check the "On the network" card on BOTH
phones.** If one shows only hubs and no geograms, expect its inbound to arrive by
pull-through-indexer (minutes), not by direct push (sub-second) — and do not read
the delay as breakage.

### Finding 4 — timing: sub-second on a warm direct link, ~minutes via an Indexer

- **Direct push** (author→peer link exists): the peer's `onNomadnetInbound` fires
  and the feed refreshes in **under a second** (`fan-out EVENT <id> -> <peer>` on
  the sender, `nomadnet-inbound: kind=N <id> PUSHED in` on the receiver).
- **Via shared Indexer** (weak leg): bounded by the 90s pull cadence plus NAT link
  warmup — several `0 answered` cycles are normal before one `1 answered
  [<hash>:<n>]` lands. Observed convergence for a reply-to-reply and a like:
  **~20 min** on the weak leg. **Restarting the app re-runs discovery**
  (`announceRelayNow` + immediate pull) and noticeably speeds convergence.

### Finding 5 — everything is a plain signed NOSTR event; id-dedup makes multi-path safe

Post, reply, reply-to-reply = kind-1 (reply carries an `e` tag to its parent);
like = kind-7; repost = kind-6. Every one is tagged **`z=rns`** at publish so the
Nomadnet feed filters mesh-native events in and the internet firehose out. Because
each event is immutable and identified by its NOSTR id, the same event arriving by
push AND by pull AND by a later sync is deduped for free (`byId` in the pull,
`seen` in verify, `INSERT OR IGNORE` by mid in the archive). This is what lets
delivery take **any** available path without coordination — and lets the same
account run on several devices and merge by id with no conflict logic.

### Finding 6 — two cursor/counter correctness rules the live test exposed

- **Pull cursor must not skip the boundary second.** Advancing the per-target
  cursor to `maxSec + 1` permanently skipped an event that shared its `created_at`
  second (a reply-to-reply typed seconds after its parent, or a clock-lagged peer).
  Store `maxSec` and re-include the boundary second; id-dedup makes the re-fetch
  free.
- **The reply badge must count the whole thread.** Counting only direct children
  showed "2" on a starter whose thread expanded 3 messages. A recursive count over
  parent links (nested descendants included) makes the badge agree with the thread.

### Finding 7 — notifications ride the same events, and must show a callsign

An interaction directed at us (kind-1/6/7 that `#p`-tags self, authored by someone
else) becomes an in-app notification via `maybeNotifyInbound` on the inbound event
— no bespoke notification channel, no wss. The name shown must resolve through
**profile name → `callsignForHex(pubkey)` (observed callsign, else derived
`X1<short>`) → raw hex only as a last resort**; showing the 12-char hex prefix
(e.g. `1b4e5d3686a0`) is a bug, and it must be fixed in every place a notification
name is rendered — the push notification AND the in-app Notifications panel.

### The corrected dependency picture

```
   role=indexer (capacity) ──piggyback announce──▶ each hears the other's role
                                    │

        ▼                                                        ▼
   direct link EXISTS (often only one direction)        NO direct link (weak NAT leg)
        │ fan-out EVENT push, sub-second                        │ converge via a
        ▼                                                        ▼ SHARED indexer both reach
   note bytes cross ◀───────────── z=rns signed event ─────────▶ pull-through, ~minutes
        └───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                                     ▼
                    id-dedup absorbs the duplicate → feed shows it once
```

The transport is no longer the wall it once was: chat-dest routing gives the links
a path, and a shared Indexer removes the need for a direct A↔B link entirely.

## The one-sentence version

Users keep what they value, Archivers hold the redundant copies, Indexers
remember where everything is, and the two networks — internet and Reticulum —
carry the same signed events, so no relay is ever load-bearing again.
